Q: Write a Python class for a object named "Tree" with the following characteristics: Trunk, Roots, Branches, Crown. Within this Class "Tree", write four different methods (functions) for each of the four seasons: Winter, Summer, Autumn, Spring plus an extra method named Vivaldi that tells a random info among ten specific information on Tree.
A: See 003_mixtral.png

The code has been reworked with codellama:7b through ollama
