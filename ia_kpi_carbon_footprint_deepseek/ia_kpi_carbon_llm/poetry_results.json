        " In the realm where ideas freely flow,\nWhere secrets whisper in quiet code,\nA movement blooms in its truest form,\nOpen Source stands strong, a proud abode.\n\nIts roots deeply entwined in sharing's grace,\nNo barrier, no limit, to reach and expand,\nFor knowledge is not something to keep locked away,\nIt thrives on openness and freedom in hand.\n\nPioneers in this realm of light,\nCraft solutions to brighten the dark,\nCreate worlds that shine, day or night,\nWhere innovation sparks a gleaming spark.\n\nThey mend, they grow, they collaborate,\nEach contributor plays a unique role,\nIn this web, connections make a wonderful fate,\nAs one creates and others make improvements whole.\n\nThere's magic in this art of open design,\nIn software we trust for peace and success,\nOpen Source continues to thrive with every sign,\nOf its ever-growing legacy we cannot suppress.\n\nSo, as I code through the twilight haze,\nMay Open Source reign strong, never swayed,\nIts beacon guiding future ways,\nTo unveil innovations never displayed.",
        " In the digital realm, where minds freely flow,\n   Lies a movement, ever-growing and aglow.\n   It's not owned nor locked in a corporate stall,\n   But stands as a testament to humanity's call.\n\n   Open Source Software, open as day,\n   Born from collaborative endeavors we sway.\n   Each line of code, a collective song,\n   Invisible bridges strong and forever long.\n\n   In libraries, forums, or the ether void,\n   Innovators gather where ideas reside.\n   Their work combined creates the open web,\n   Where all may build with understanding, without fret.\n\n   Free to change, modify, remix, create,\n   Unshackled by hidden chains of monetaryRATE.\n   In schools, offices, or within the night,\n   Developers' fingers tap with pure delight.\n\n   For knowledge is power in the human hand,\n   The open-source journey through life will stand.\n   From the lowly app to software immense,\n   Progress unfolds like an expanding sentence.\n\n   Open Source Software stands, ageless and wise,\n   Empowering creators 'neath skies vast and size.\n   May this verse capture its magic so bright,\n   Encouraging future explorations in light."
