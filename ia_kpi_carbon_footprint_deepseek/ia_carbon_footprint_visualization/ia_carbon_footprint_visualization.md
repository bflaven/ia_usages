## MODEL_PROMPT_1
As an expert in drawing, can you illustrate only with sketches that look like visual notetaking the use cases for IA: create a dashboard that show several KPIs for carbon footprint measurement using a LLM like Claude, Grok, ChatGPT, Perplexity or Mistral both through an API or locally on a computer. Do not use computer images, just drawing.
This image will be used for a thumbnail of YouTube video, so make it appealing and clickable.
