## Summary
The 'Green' AI Myth: Carbon Costs of ML Models & Insights on GEO and DeepSeek Fine-tuning [https://wp.me/p3Vuhl-3nO](https://wp.me/p3Vuhl-3nO)

**This post explores the multifaceted role of AI, focusing on its optimization (GEO), environmental impact, and corporate social responsibility.** It discusses how AI's emergence is reshaping web searches and business models, potentially disrupting the link economy.  A significant portion examines AI's carbon footprint, referencing tools like CodeCarbon and Eco2AI for measurement, while advocating for a rational approach to AI usage and awareness of the "Jevons Paradox." **The text also assesses DeepSeek, highlighting its potential to challenge existing AI ecosystems and offering insights into fine-tuning custom models with Python.** Furthermore, it provides an interesting, and humorous, semantic study of the names of AI leader brands (DeepSeek, Mistral, Claude) and their cultural associations, and closes by presenting the German tradition of "Unwort des Jahres" (non-word of the year) in relation to AI.
