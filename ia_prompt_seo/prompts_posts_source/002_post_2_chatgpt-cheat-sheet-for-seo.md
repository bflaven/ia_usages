## Best ChatGPT Prompts for Content Creation

**1. Ask ChatGPT to Generate Topic Ideas**

ChatGPT can help you generate topic ideas for blog posts, articles, videos, and podcasts. Using the example prompt below, ChatGPT was able to generate a range of content ideas for on-page SEO. 

Example prompt: 

```bash

```


**2. Ask ChatGPT to Create an Outline**

ChatGPT can help you create outlines for articles and video scripts by including all essential headings and subheadings with proper descriptions. 

Example prompt: 
```bash

Example prompt:

**3. Ask ChatGPT to Generate SEO Title and Meta Description**

You can ask ChatGPT to generate compelling title tags and meta descriptions for your articles or blog posts. In this example, we’ve asked ChatGPT to create a meta description for a new article we’ve created.

The result is a great starting point, but it’s actually a little too long (Google search would truncate this). One way to handle this is to manually shorten it, or we could use a follow-up prompt that provides an optional character limit.

Can you shorten this to stay within 160 characters?
