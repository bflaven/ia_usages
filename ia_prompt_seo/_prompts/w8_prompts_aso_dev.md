Sure, here's an efficient prompt to optimize the title and subtitle for the RFI Pure Radio app:

"**Optimize Your App's Title and Subtitle:**

**Current Title:** RFI Pure Radio

**Current Subtitle:** All RFI's programs and podcasts

**Analysis:** The current title and subtitle are clear and concise, but they could be improved to better highlight the app's unique features and benefits. The title doesn't include any relevant keywords, and the subtitle could be more specific and compelling.

**Recommendations:**

- **Title:** Incorporate a relevant keyword into the title, such as 'Live' or 'News'. For example, 'RFI Live News Radio' or 'RFI Pure Radio: News & Podcasts'. This will make it more appealing to users who are looking for a live news radio app or a podcast app.
- **Subtitle:** Make the subtitle more specific and compelling by highlighting the app's key features and benefits. For example, 'Stream Live News 24/7 & Access 1000+ Podcasts' or 'Tune into Global News & Insightful Podcasts'. This will give users a clearer idea of what they can expect from the app and why they should download it.

**Next Steps:**

- Brainstorm a list of potential titles and subtitles based on the above recommendations.
- Conduct keyword research to identify relevant and high-traffic keywords to incorporate into the title and subtitle.
- Test different title and subtitle combinations to see which ones perform best in terms of click-through rate and conversion rate.
- Regularly review and update the title and subtitle to ensure they're still relevant and effective."
