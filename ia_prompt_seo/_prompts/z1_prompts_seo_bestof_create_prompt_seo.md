### Key SEO Practices Applied:
1. **Title Tag**: The title is descriptive and includes relevant keywords.
2. **Meta Description**: A concise summary of the article that includes keywords.
3. **Heading Tags**: Organized structure with `<H1>` for the main title, and `<H2>` for key sections. This hierarchy helps search engines understand the content structure.
4. **Internal Links**: Using anchor tags for internal navigation and to provide additional context.
5. **External Links**: Anchors with `target="_self"` to stay within the same browsing context, as specified.
6. **Alt Tags**: Not applicable here but important for images.
7. **Readable and Structured Content**: Breaking content into sections with clear headings enhances readability and SEO.

This structure helps search engines index the content efficiently and improves the user experience.

As an SEO expert, first, can you generate a prompt that analyzes the HTML code structuration for a page named "sample_structure_pots.html" and ensure that the code and the content is well structured to optimize SEO. 


Second, if the HTML code is incorrect, you can provide corrections with a new HTML code so so the user can cut and paste it. 

Third, in the example below, the post is in french and about the CAN 2024 (Coupe d'afrique des nations), can you provide another HTML template on the subject "the benefits of yoga for mental health" where you can give your own HTML structuration as example.

```html
<!-- structuration example  -->
<h1>[titre de l'article] e.g CAN 2024 : ce qu'il faut savoir</h1>
[chapô]
Intro
<h2>[sous-titre important] e.g Quand et où aura lieu la CAN 2024</h2>
Texte
<h2>[sous-titre important] e.g Quelles équipes participent à la CAN 2024</h2>

# Mistral_1
Sure, I can help with that!

First, to analyze the HTML code structuration for a page named "sample\_structure\_pots.html", you can use an SEO tool such as Screaming Frog or Google Search Console to crawl the page and identify any issues with the HTML code and content. Some common issues to look for include:

* Missing or duplicate title tags and meta descriptions
* Headings that are not properly nested or structured (e.g., using an H3 tag before an H2 tag)
* Lack of descriptive and keyword-rich headings and subheadings
* Images that are missing alt tags or have generic file names
* Thin or low-quality content that does not provide value to users

If the HTML code is incorrect, you can provide corrections with a new HTML code that follows best practices for SEO. Here's an example HTML template for a post about "the benefits of yoga for mental health":
```html
