## Mistral

Sure, I can help you make the prompt more versatile to accommodate different languages. Here's an updated version:

```python
prompt_template = f'''
In the language "{language}", could you, as an SEO expert, generate 10 engaging headline ideas for a post about "{user_input}"?
'''
```

In this version, you can replace `"language"` with the desired language (like 'French', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Russian', etc.) and `"user_input"` with the topic of the post. This way, the prompt will be suitable for any language that ChatGPT understands.
