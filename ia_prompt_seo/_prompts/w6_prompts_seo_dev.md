## prompt_1
As an advanced prompt engineer in LMM and IA, between the two prompts below, which one performs the most among these three templates. First, is it required to use "[INST]" and "[/INST]" at the beginning and the end of the prompt. Second, is it a good practice to indicate variables that will be replaced by value between quote "" or single quote ''. Third, give a list of advice to enhance prompts and give for each best practices a real life example.


```python

prompt_templat_1 = f'''
As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about '{source}' in the same language as the post?
'''
    
prompt_template_2 = f'''
[INST] As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about '{source}' in the same language as the post? [/INST]
'''
    
prompt_template_3 = f'''
[INST] As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about "{source}" in the same language as the post? [/INST]
'''

Evaluating the performance of the provided templates involves considering various aspects of prompt engineering and best practices. Here are the answers to the three main questions:

### 1. Usage of "[INST]" and "[/INST]"
Whether "[INST]" and "[/INST]" are required depends on the specific language model (LM) or interactive assistant (IA) you are using. These tags might be specific to certain frameworks or models that require instruction delimiters. For general models, these tags might not be necessary and can be omitted unless specified by the framework documentation.

**Example**:
- **Required**: Specific interactive assistants (like OpenAI’s Codex) might require instruction delimiters for certain structured inputs.
- **Not Required**: General-purpose language models like GPT-3 do not typically require such delimiters.

### 2. Indicating Variables with Quotes
Using quotes (either single or double) around variables is a good practice as it helps clearly distinguish the variable content from the rest of the text. It enhances readability and reduces ambiguity, especially when the variable contains spaces or special characters.

**Example**:
- **With Quotes**: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about 'digital marketing strategies' in the same language as the post?
- **Without Quotes**: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about digital marketing strategies in the same language as the post?

### 3. Enhancing Prompts: Best Practices and Examples
Here are several best practices for enhancing prompts along with real-life examples:

#### a. Be Specific and Clear
Specify exactly what you want the model to do. Ambiguity can lead to less accurate results.

**Example**:
- **Less Specific**: Write headlines about technology.
- **More Specific**: Write 10 compelling headlines for a blog post about the latest advancements in artificial intelligence.

#### b. Provide Context
Giving the model more context can improve the relevance and quality of the output.

**Example**:
- **Less Context**: Write a summary.
- **More Context**: Write a 200-word summary of the key points discussed in the article about the benefits of renewable energy sources.

#### c. Use Proper Formatting
Format the prompt to make it easy to read and understand.

**Example**:
- **Less Formatted**: Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning.
- **Better Formatted**: 
  ```
  Explain the difference between:
  1. Machine Learning
  2. Deep Learning
  ```

#### d. Define the Output Structure
Tell the model the desired structure of the output.

**Example**:
- **Undefined Structure**: Provide some tips for SEO.
- **Defined Structure**: List 5 tips for improving SEO, each followed by a brief explanation.

#### e. Use Positive Instructions
Frame instructions in a positive manner to guide the model towards what you want.

**Example**:
- **Negative Instruction**: Don’t write a short summary.
- **Positive Instruction**: Write a detailed and comprehensive summary.

#### f. Include Examples
Providing examples can guide the model on the expected format and style.

**Example**:
- **Without Example**: Write an introduction to a blog post about healthy eating.
- **With Example**: Write an introduction to a blog post about healthy eating. For example, "Eating healthy is essential for maintaining both physical and mental well-being. In this blog post, we will explore..."

### Comparing the Provided Prompts
Given the three templates:

```python
prompt_templat_1 = f'''
As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about '{source}' in the same language as the post?
'''

prompt_template_2 = f'''
[INST] As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about '{source}' in the same language as the post? [/INST]
'''

prompt_template_3 = f'''
[INST] As an SEO expert proficient: Could you create 10 compelling headline ideas for a post about "{source}" in the same language as the post? [/INST]
```

- **Template 1**: This is straightforward and does not include instruction tags, making it suitable for general-purpose LMs.
- **Template 2 and 3**: These include instruction tags, which might be necessary for specific models or frameworks. The difference between single and double quotes is minor and usually does not impact the output significantly, but double quotes are generally preferred for consistency in JSON-like formats.

**Recommendation**: Start with **Template 1** unless your framework specifies the need for instruction tags. Ensure variables are enclosed in quotes to avoid ambiguity.


## Mistral
The three templates you've provided are quite similar, with the main differences being the use of "[INST]" and "[/INST]" tags and the type of quotes used around the "{source}" variable.

1. Regarding the use of "[INST]" and "[/INST]" tags: These are typically used in machine learning models to denote the beginning and end of the instruction or prompt. However, their necessity depends on the specific system or model you're using. If your model or system is designed to recognize and process instructions based on these tags, then yes, it's important to include them. If not, they're not strictly necessary.

2. As for the use of quotes around the "{source}" variable: In Python, both single and double quotes can be used to denote a string, so both '"{source}"' and '{source}' are valid. The choice between them is usually based on readability and the contents of the string itself. If the string contains a single quote, for example, you might choose to use double quotes to avoid having to escape the single quote.

3. Here are some general tips for creating effective prompts:

   - **Be clear and specific**: The more precise your prompt, the more likely you are to get the response you're looking for. For example, instead of saying "Write about dogs," you might say "Write a short, informative paragraph about the history of dog domestication."

   - **Use a natural, conversational tone**: This can help the model understand the context and nuances of your request. For instance, "Could you help me understand the theory of relativity?" is more natural and conversational than "Explain the theory of relativity."

   - **Provide examples when necessary**: If you're asking for something that could be interpreted in multiple ways, providing an example can help clarify your request. For example, "Write a haiku about the moon. Here's an example of a haiku: 'An old silent pond / A frog jumps into the pond / Splash! Silence again.'"

   - **Test and iterate**: The first prompt you try might not be the most effective one. Don't be afraid to experiment with different phrasings, levels of detail, and so on to find what works best.

Each of these best practices is applicable in various real-life scenarios. For instance, in a customer service chatbot, using a natural, conversational tone can make the interaction feel more human and less robotic, which can improve the customer's experience. Similarly, in an educational tool that uses AI to generate study materials, providing examples can help ensure that the materials are accurate and helpful.
