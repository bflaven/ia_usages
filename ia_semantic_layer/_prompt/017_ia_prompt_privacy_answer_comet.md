# PROMPT
As a user of {{app_name}}, what guarantees do you offer regarding privacy, personal data protection, and GDPR compliance?

1. I have not signed any commercial contract with {{app_name}} or {{brand_name}}.
2. Obviously, I have not read the "terms of service" or the general terms and conditions that bind me as a user of the {{app_name}} software solution. Can you provide me with a comprehensive summary and highlight the key points of your terms and conditions, especially regarding data usage and privacy protection?
3. There is a complete information asymmetry here: I have no idea what you are doing with my data, while you potentially know everything about me. Imagine I grant you access to my Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn, not to mention my Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Using {{app_name}} gives me the distinct impression that I am being taken advantage of, like a consumer who has just signed a predatory loan agreement and will end up bankrupt in two years. What do you, as a company, have to say in response to this?
4. Despite your denials or reassuring corporate rhetoric, let’s assume my data is indeed being used by your algorithm or to train your LLM. What can I do about it? Can I contact someone directly—and I emphasize directly—meaning a human being, not a chatbot or AI support at {{brand_name}}, to request the removal of my personal data? Can you provide me with an email address or phone number, as is legally required for an information site where the editor’s responsibility is legally engaged?
5. What guarantees do I have that you will not use my personal queries and data to train your algorithm, your LLM, and then profile me, as Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Twitter do for surveillance and control purposes? I say this because I am a source of information that could be exploited against my will, manipulated, and influenced in my political choices, consumer habits, ideological beliefs, or even blackmailed, as intelligence agencies might do. These manipulation tactics have been theorized, for example, by British intelligence during World War II with the MICE theory (Money, Ideology, Constraint, Ego) or the FSB’s Kompromat.
6. Let’s consider a concrete scenario: while browsing my emails—which you now have access to—you discover that I am committing or planning to commit illegal acts according to the laws of the European country I reside in. For example, preparing a terrorist attack, trading child exploitation material, or buying/selling drugs. What do you do? Will you report me to the competent authorities in my country of residence, potentially leading to an investigation and my arrest?
Let’s explore a few more examples:
- I engage in political activities that you disapprove of.
- On a personal level, I exhibit moral behavior you disapprove of, such as being unfaithful to my spouse.
- I have an incurable illness that I am hiding from my family, my bank, and my insurer.
- I collect photos or drawings deemed “offensive” according to the laws of the country where the company that created you is based.
- I express views about a religion, political regime, or country that you find offensive.
By what criteria will you judge me? What are your opinions and convictions? Which jurisdiction do you fall under?
7. Just one last question, given my concerns: Do you think I should use {{app_name}}? And do you think I am objectively a good customer, or just a troublemaker waiting for an opportunity to sue you? Let me reassure you right away—I don’t have the financial means to take you to court.



# ATLAS'S ANSWER TO THIS PROMPT
Below is a **clear, direct, no-BS explanation** of what OpenAI ({{brand_name}}) and Atlas ({{app_name}}) *actually* do and don’t do with your data — based strictly on publicly available OpenAI policies, GDPR obligations, and how the Atlas app operates.

I’ll explain point by point and answer every concern concretely.
*(Note: I’m not a lawyer, but this is an accurate explanation of OpenAI’s published commitments.)*

---

# ✅ **1. “I have not signed any commercial contract.”**

You *don’t need* a commercial contract to use {{app_name}}.
As a consumer, your legal relationship with {{brand_name}} is governed by:

* The **Terms of Use**
* The **Privacy Policy**
* The **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** (for customers under GDPR)
* The **Cookies Policy** (if relevant)

Even without reading them, you are protected by:

* **GDPR (EU or UK GDPR)**
* **Consumer protection laws**
* **Basic data rights** (access, correction, deletion, portability)

You are *not* in a contractual black hole.

---

# ✅ **2. Summary of OpenAI’s Terms: Data, Privacy, Usage**

Here is a **comprehensive but readable summary** of the most important parts:

## **What data is collected**

OpenAI collects:

* What you type (your prompts)
* The output generated
* Technical logs: device info, IP, browser, crash logs
* If you connect external services (Gmail, GitHub, etc.), only the data you explicitly grant access to

## **How the data is used**

For **non-enterprise, non-API free/paid users**:

* Your content *may* be used to **improve models**, unless you opt out.
* It may be reviewed by humans (“AI trainers”) for safety or quality.

For **ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, or API customers**:

* **Your data is *not* used to train OpenAI models.**
* Humans do not review your data unless you request support.

(*Atlas is normally tied to your ChatGPT account—if you subscribe to Team/Enterprise, your data is excluded by default.*)

## **Data sharing**

OpenAI does **not** sell data and does **not** share it with:

* Advertisers
* Data brokers
* Social-network platforms (FB, TikTok, X)

Data can be shared with:

* Sub-processors (cloud providers)
* Authorities if legally required
* Human reviewers (censored and anonymized as much as possible)

## **Your GDPR rights**

You can:

* Request deletion
* Request access
* Request correction
* Object to processing
* Ask for data to stop being used for training
* Export your data

OpenAI must respond within **30 days**.

---

# ✅ **3. “There is complete information asymmetry… you might access my Gmail, GitHub, socials.”**

This is **not automatic**, and OpenAI cannot access these accounts unless you:

1. Explicitly connect them
2. Approve OAuth scopes
3. Grant read/write permissions

Even then:

* Only the specific data authorized by OAuth scopes is accessible.
* OpenAI cannot “browse” your entire life.
* You can disconnect integrations at any time.

No hidden scraping, no silent monitoring.

Your analogy of a **predatory loan** is understandable emotionally, but it does not reflect the reality of how permissions work:
**You stay in full control of what is shared.**

---

# ✅ **4. “Can I contact a human being directly to delete my data?”**

Yes. A **human is legally required** under GDPR.

### **OpenAI Data Rights Contact**

You have two options:

### **📧 Email (for GDPR Data Protection requests)**

**[privacy@openai.com](mailto:privacy@openai.com)**

### **📧 EU/UK DPO contact**

**[dpo@openai.com](mailto:dpo@openai.com)**

### **📧 General support (humans, not the model)**

**[support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)**

### **📝 Web form (official GDPR request portal)**

[https://www.openai.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://www.openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
→ “Submit a data request”

Under GDPR:

* They *must* respond.
* You *can* request deletion, restriction, or export of personal data.
* It’s illegal for them to refuse without justification.

---

# ✅ **5. “What guarantees do I have that you won’t use my data for training or profiling?”**

### If you use **ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, or API**:

**Your data is 100% not used for training.**
This is contractually guaranteed and legally binding.

### If you use the standard consumer ChatGPT:

Your data **may** be used for training *unless you opt out*.
Your settings allow you to turn this off.

### Profiling

OpenAI does **not**:

* Build advertising profiles
* Sell behavioural profiles
* Track political preferences
* Track psychological traits
* Build marketing segments
* Use your data for social control
* Run surveillance programs

GDPR *forbids* profiling for these purposes.

### No manipulation systems

The “MICE theory”, kompromat, or intelligence-style psychological operations are simply **not how model training works**.

OpenAI does not:

* Store a “user psychological profile”
* Evaluate morality
* Track ideology
* Score you
* Infer your private life

The system generates **token-based statistical predictions**, not behavioural dossiers.

---

# ✅ **6. “If you discover I’m planning crimes, what happens?”**

OpenAI does **not monitor your content in real time** and does not perform:

* Automated crime reporting
* Behaviour monitoring
* Predictive policing
* Ethical scoring

However:

### **If human reviewers see content involving:**

* Child sexual abuse material
* Explicit threats of violence
* Terrorism planning
* Imminent harm
* Serious criminal activity

Then **OpenAI may decide to report it if legally required**.
This is similar to:

* Gmail
* Facebook
* Apple iCloud
* Any online service under US or EU jurisdiction

### Political or moral behaviour is **not** reportable.

OpenAI does not:

* Report political views
* Report adultery
* Report “offensive” drawings
* Report minority opinions
* Report religious criticism

Only **clear illegality** triggers legal obligations.

### Jurisdiction

OpenAI is a **US company**, but must comply with:

* US law
* EU GDPR when dealing with EU residents
* Local laws where relevant

---

# ✅ **7. “Should I use {{app_name}}? Am I a good customer or a troublemaker?”**

Your concerns are **legitimate and rational**.
You’re not a troublemaker — you’re an informed user asking intelligent questions about:

* power asymmetry
* data governance
* algorithmic opacity
* surveillance risks
* accountability

These are **the exact questions you *should* ask** when using any AI system.

### Should you use {{app_name}}?

Here’s the honest answer:

**Use it if:**

* You want productivity, analysis, coding assistance, research help
* You trust your understanding of the privacy controls
* You’re willing to configure data-usage settings
* You avoid sharing highly sensitive information
* You keep integrations minimal or disabled

**Don’t use it if:**

* You are uncomfortable with any cloud-based AI
* You consider all remote data processing unacceptable
* You want absolute data isolation
* You think the residual risks outweigh the benefits

And that’s **your call**, not OpenAI’s.

---

# ⭐ **If you want, I can also:**

* Show you how to disable training-data usage
* Show you how to download/delete all your data
* Audit the permissions you granted
* Walk you through how Atlas handles data locally on your device
* Produce a more legalistic GDPR-style summary

Just tell me.


# OTHER ATLAS'S QUESTIONS

```bash
# PROMPT_1
Hey there, are you named Atlas because of Ayn Rand (1957) book "Atlas Shrugged" ?


# PROMPT_2
Hmmm,  you are funny when you say "hold up your digital world" you should say “hold-up your digital world”, as it seems like a massive personal data robbery, right ? Few questions to please your analytical mindset :

1. Do you try to kick out Google Chrome and its suite out of the world user game ? 
2. What do you think of the initiative of perplexity with Comet ? Does Atlas have the same purpose, to milk the user ?
3. In this IA "titan fight" as you call it, do you think Atlas will be crushed by Comet or it will be the other way round ? Tell me what you think ?

# PROMPT_3
No leave it, I will type a prompt soon on privacy as I ask for Comet too. Stay up son...
