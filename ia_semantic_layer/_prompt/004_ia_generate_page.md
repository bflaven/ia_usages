## INFOS
A tags cloud in WordPress is a visual representation of the tags you’ve assigned to posts on your website, displaying up to 100 of the most commonly used tags in varying font sizes—where the most frequently used tags appear larger. Each tag is a clickable link, usually leading visitors to an archive page listing all posts associated with that tag.[1][3][8][9]

### Purpose and Benefits

- The tags cloud helps visitors quickly see the main topics or themes covered on your site, making it easier for them to discover content by interest.[9][10]
- It's also helpful for site organization and can indirectly improve SEO by enhancing internal linking and highlighting key subjects.[7][9]

### How It Works

- Tags are added to posts as descriptive keywords.
- The tag cloud widget or block examines all tags and generates a visual cloud where size correlates with frequency of use.[2][3][1]
- Clicking a tag in the cloud brings users to a filtered view of related posts.[3][8]

### Adding a Tag Cloud

- In the block editor, you can insert a Tag Cloud block to any page or post through the “+ Block Inserter,” or type `/tag cloud` to add it instantly.[1][3]
- There are also widgets and plugins for more customizable tag clouds, with various settings for display, style, and which taxonomies to include.[5][6]

A tags cloud is a simple, effective navigational tool for both users and search engines, visually surfacing the main themes of your WordPress site.[7][9]
