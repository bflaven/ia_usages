## PROMPT
As a Python and MLflow expert, fix the script as it does not work, I do not have access to the Ollama locally. The Ollama is available on the machine. Here is some additional information about the config. Fix it and rewrite the all script so I just cut and paste


```text
# Mlflow VM PROD
MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=[username]
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=[site]/mlflow
DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT=[default_artifact_root]
MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENTS_TARGET=[site]/mlflow_gateway
```


## OUTPUT
