## PROMPT
As a Python and MLflow expert, fixing the script does not produce what I want. I gave you an example that I have made manually and here is the result that I want. Please fix the script so it produces an identical result and keep the variables as they are as I can set them. Your script does not produce any result.

- Run name: `redolent-mouse-746` 
- stock_type: `books` 
- output: `"Discover your next favorite read! Unleash the power of knowledge with our vast collection of books at your fingertips - Shop now!"`
