## PROMPT
As a Python and MLflow expert, It creates a run but it does not fill the values inside the run I have made manually e.g.

- Run name: `redolent-mouse-746` 
- stock_type: `books` 
- output: `"Discover your next favorite read! Unleash the power of knowledge with our vast collection of books at your fingertips - Shop now!"` 


## OUTPUT
