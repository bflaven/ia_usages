## PROMPT
As a Python and MLflow expert, write a python script that list all the experiments from the URL that I have given.

1. The mlflow that I want to query is this one `[site]/mlflow/#/experiments`. The url is protected by an .htaccess here the information `username="toto`, `password="titi123"`
2. The version of mlflow used is `3.3.1`
3. If you need to find information, you can check the following resource:
`https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/index.html`

 



## OUTPUT
See 0001_mlflow_python_api.py


Does it mean I have to install to make the csript working?
pip install mlflow
pip install os
pip install sys
pip install typing
pip install logging
