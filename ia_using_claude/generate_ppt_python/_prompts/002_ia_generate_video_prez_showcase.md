## PROMPT_ENHANCED_1

As a consultant and keynote speaker, propose a narrative path for a film presenting the integration of AI in a back office called Artichoke.

Prints the result in a ```text...``` without readme tags like `**`, `##`... etc.

The film must not exceed 3 minutes in length. The presentation will be in English only.

1. Topic: Present the integration of artificial intelligence into Artichoke, the in-house CMS used by the newsrooms. This presentation will be followed by a video exploring the CMS's various screens. AI in Artichoke includes transcription and multilingual AGI functions. This service processes audio and video content from the broadcast for the internal CMS, generating a transcript and metadata (title, summary, keywords, category) associated with the audio and video content, articles, and edits.

2. Audience: The audience consists of journalists of different nationalities, with varying levels of understanding of artificial intelligence issues, ranging from early adopters to laggards.

3. Film flow: Present the case of a journalist using the back office who accesses a video or audio editing page. They can view the transcript and use the AGI wizard to retrieve elements from a prompt, such as the title, summary, keywords, and category. Video and audio content are child elements that can be the default media for parent elements such as editions and articles. If audio or video is the default media for an edition or article content type, transcription and AGI features are available on the page. There is therefore a logical connection between the "parents" (edition, article) and the "children" (main media: audio, video).
