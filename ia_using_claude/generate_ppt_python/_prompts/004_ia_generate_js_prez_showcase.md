## PROMPT_3

Écris-moi, avec reveal.js, une véritable la présentation en français depuis le texte fourni dans le chemin de fer.
Dans le code fourni, je veux que tu donnes des numéros à chaque slide comme suit SLIDE_1, SLIDE_2, SLIDE_3... en commentaire dans le code html.
Sens-toi libre de mettre en avant des mots-clés qui te semblent importants soit en gras soit une slide unique. Attention cette présentation va être utilisée au cours d’une vidéo tutoriel de 3 minutes, elle doit donc être synthétique.
