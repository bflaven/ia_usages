As a consultant and keynote speaker, I propose a compelling narrative structure for a PowerPoint presentation for an audience of journalists from an international media group.

The presentation must be divided into slides, making sure to number them: SLIDE_1, SLIDE_2, SLIDE_3, etc.

The presentation must not exceed 8 minutes. This includes the video.

1. Subject: [define your subject with successive notes] This is to present the integration of artificial intelligence into the in-house CMS. The latter is the back office used by the editorial offices. This presentation will be followed by the broadcast of a video that will go through the different screens of the in-house CMS. Artificial intelligence within the CMS consists of the integration of transcription and AGI functions in multilingual. This service links the transcription and AGI functions to process all audio and video content from the broadcast to the internal CMS. For each file processed, this generates a transcript and metadata (title, summary, keywords, category) which are associated with the content, such as audio and video files, but also articles and editions, which have an audio or video file processed by artificial intelligence as default media.

2. Audience: [define your audience by successive notes] e.g., the audience is a population of participants of different nationalities and varying levels of understanding of the challenges of artificial intelligence, ranging from early adopters to laggards.

3. Other language elements

It is necessary to announce the beginning of the program of what will come next:

After this presentation, it is necessary to announce what will begin.

3.1 An editorial validation process for transcripts and AGI.

This validation process is built on a feedback loop with beta testers. This involves first conducting a general validation from an editorial perspective, followed by providing specific feedback on both the transcription and the AI. This process will be conducted in French, English, and then Spanish. Using this feedback, it may be considered to retrain or fine-tune the models used to improve editorial performance and personalize the results of editorial proposals to better reflect the tone of the various editorial teams.

This process requires two conditions:

- 1 - This requires the availability of the journalists selected from the beta tester sample and a certain discipline in providing feedback, particularly through a contact person who will be the AI ​​team's single point of contact.
- 2 - A collective definition of the expected level of quality, i.e., achieving a sufficient level of "quality" for the transcriptions and AI results to be deemed reliable.

3.2 Collective Co-creation Work
It should also be made clear that, beyond editorial validation, this is also a collective effort to co-create an AI product. This process will necessarily be iterative and collective.

3.3 Addressing Irritants and Pain Points with a High Impact
There will likely also be the need to address pain points within the CMS to make tangible the productivity induced by AI on tasks that are uninteresting, time-consuming, and sometimes even tedious.

3.4 Addressing Irritants and Pain Points with a High Impact
Finally, it is possible to include the following keywords, which are all elements of language. However, try to provide context for each of these words in relation to the content of the presentation that was given. The list is as follows: scalability, model sovereignty, data security, data confidentiality, cost control, editorial validation, multilingualism, model fine-tuning, carbon footprint, training
