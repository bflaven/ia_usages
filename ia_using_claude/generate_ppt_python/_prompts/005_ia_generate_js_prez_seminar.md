## PROMPT_ENHANCED_1

Can you refine the prompt below and print it to a ```text...``` without readme tags like `**`, `##`... etc.

```text
As a revealjs expert, can you write a complete proposition for a presentation form these elements :

1. presentation that works locally on a computer and gives the instructions to install all the stuff.
2. use the text below, shrink and enhance to generate compelling slides so I can use the presentation inside the video as a presentation support to emphasize this or this element.

```


## PROMPT_2


Modify the presentation's HTML code:

1. Rewrite the HTML in each slide, including `<section></section>`, so that the code is structured as follows: `<div class="content"></div>`, `<div class="subfooter"></div>`, `<div class="footer"></div>`, and so that there is no stacking or overlapping of the text contained within. The `<div class="subfooter"></div>` div will manage the spacing between the content div and the footer div.

2. Invert the colors, change the background to white and the text to black.

3. Integrate this font using "inter-v13-latin-100.eot" for the text, providing the commands to install this in the theme if necessary. 

4. on all slides, include at the bottom, in the center, the following logo "logo.png" and the mention "Â© 2025 Copyright My Brand" in a div`<div class="footer"></div>`
