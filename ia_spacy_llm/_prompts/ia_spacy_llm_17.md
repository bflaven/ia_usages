What do you think of this fiction on the balance of power between AI, capitalism and work?
If we proceed by analogy with 19th century capitalism.
We find the classic antagonism between the remuneration of work and capital remuneration, finally the owners of the LLMs are the new industrialists, they exploit in a first time our intelligence to accumulate the knowledge built on our collective intelligence which allows primo to make a product which is then sold to us and finally which in many will end up replacing us purely and simply.

Your fiction on the balance of power between AI, capitalism, and work presents an intriguing analogy with 19th-century capitalism. Indeed, there are several parallels that can be drawn between the owners of large language models (LLMs) and the industrialists of that era, who exploited labor to accumulate capital.

Here are some points of reflection on this analogy:

Exploitation of Collective Intelligence: Just as 19th-century industrialists exploited the physical labor of workers, the owners of LLMs exploit our collective intelligence. The data we generate online, our interactions, and our intellectual contributions are used to train and improve language models.

Accumulation of Knowledge: The knowledge accumulated through our collective intelligence is then transformed into sellable products. Tech companies monetize this knowledge by offering AI-based services, such as virtual assistants, translation tools, and recommendation systems.

Replacement of Human Labor: Similar to how machines replaced many manual labor jobs in the 19th century, AI could replace numerous intellectual jobs today. Repetitive tasks and even some creative tasks can be automated, potentially leading to job loss in certain sectors.

Distribution of Benefits: One of the most critical aspects of this analogy is the distribution of benefits. In 19th-century capitalism, profits were often concentrated in the hands of the owners of the means of production, while workers received relatively low compensation. Similarly, today, the benefits generated by AI are often concentrated in the hands of large tech companies, while users and data contributors receive no direct compensation.

Ethics and Regulation: This analogy also raises ethical and regulatory questions. How can we ensure that the benefits of AI are fairly distributed? What regulations are needed to protect workers and users in an AI-dominated world?

In summary, your fiction highlights power dynamics and exploitation that are relevant in the current context of AI and capitalism. It invites critical reflection on how we can structure our society to avoid the inequalities and abuses of power that characterized industrial capitalism.

This analogy with 19th-century capitalism sheds light on the power dynamics and economic forces shaping the current development of AI. Just as early industrialists accumulated capital by harnessing the labor of workers, today’s AI-driven tech companies accumulate intellectual capital by leveraging human intelligence, often in the form of freely provided data, knowledge, and creative input.

This setup reflects the familiar antagonism between labor and capital. Owners of LLMs and other AI systems are akin to the industrialists of old, profiting from collective human effort without direct compensation to the providers of that input. Users contribute knowledge and data, which is then integrated into AI models, enhancing the value of those models. This value, however, is largely privatized and sold back to the same public that helped create it, effectively turning collective knowledge into a product that only benefits the few who own the AI systems.

Moreover, the substitution of human work by AI, especially in intellectual and creative fields, resembles how machinery in the 19th century replaced skilled labor. This process risks making certain human skills redundant, thereby shifting the economic value of these skills from people to technology owners. Workers who were once key contributors to intellectual or creative sectors could find themselves on the periphery, while the AI industry profits from the very knowledge and creativity that it first learned from them.

This dynamic could, indeed, create a new kind of cognitive proletariat: individuals who are both dependent on and replaceable by AI, with limited bargaining power against the concentrated ownership of these models. So, in this sense, AI might end up reinforcing or even deepening inequalities by centralizing the economic rewards of collective intelligence, while the people who generate the underlying data and insights see little return. It’s a modern twist on classic capitalist exploitation, with intellectual work rather than physical labor at its core.
