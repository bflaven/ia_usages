## Intro
A post that explores the author's concerns about the potential downsides of artificial intelligence (AI). They express skepticism about AI's purported benefits, highlighting fears about its impact on the environment, the labor market, and the production of relevant, useful content. The author then focuses on the challenge of evaluating the quality of AI-generated text, specifically addressing how to ensure it is "correct" and avoids "hallucinations" - instances where AI produces inaccurate or nonsensical output. They introduce the concept of "sentence embeddings" as a potential solution, explaining how it allows for comparing sentences based on meaning rather than just words. The author then presents their approach for validating the quality of AI-generated text using the "spacy-llm" package, along with other tools like "pytextrank" and "pysentence-similarity," all with the goal of ensuring the usefulness of AI-generated content.
