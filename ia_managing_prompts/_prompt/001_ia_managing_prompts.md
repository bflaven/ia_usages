## PROMPT_3

As a python developer can you extend the python script 
1. there is by default a "Prompt Registry" that let the user "Manage your prompt templates programmatically or through the web editor". On this page, add a button "Create Prompt" to add a new prompt that will lead to the form to add prompt.
2. For the prompt, add keywords so the user can add some keywords to specify the nature of the prompt and its usage: creation, content, Seo...etc.
3. The connector is a dropdown menu that load connectors that are store in a new table in prompts.db. The connector is defined by two fields LLM Provider and Model. The user when he creates the prompt can defined these two variables.
