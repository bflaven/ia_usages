## Intro


## 1. Human Advisory
The text has been written by Claude. It sucks a bit. It was clearly offensive and clickbait oriented with a pretty misinterpretation when the post talks more on ideas related to philosophy and politics.
Claude will me make think that I am communist, no good for a LinkedIn post :) So, I will probalbly reinjected a certain corporate BS into it.

Anyway I leave the intro as it is... Check 3.

## 2. Humanized AI Generated Intro

I'd somewhat abandoned posting on LinkedIn‚Äîearly symptoms of information overload, no doubt, and saturation with AI news.

AI is like broccoli: if you eat it every day, it gets tiresome!

Still, an interesting topic emerged a few months ago: **AI and automation, with or without n8n!** I have a passion for automation, especially in QA, because let's face it‚Äîit's the productive consecration of laziness. Al Sweigart, if you're reading this, you know what I'm talking about.

So I've resumed posting and exploring: "Rescuing Failed AI Implementations + Practical Explorations with n8n, Ollama & GEO"

The topic is AI and automation, but I want to keep control (sovereignty, security, confidentiality). I'm willing to be AI's "slave," but I'm keeping the keys to the handcuffs.

So I dove into this promising combo: **AI and Automation with n8n**. 

Why n8n? Well, why reinvent the wheel! 

The idea was to mix AI/Automation/n8n with some best practices: MCP, Agents, Claude Desktop, and open-source models powered by Ollama.

There's more than potential here‚Äîthere's what I've pompously called **the automation of white-collar work**.

**Through this work, I found my next subject: AI Text Humanizer or AI Text Polisher to improve text generation.** Because if AI is going to write for us, we might as well make it sound less robotic.

**But there's another shift happening: Search engines are dead, long live the LLMs.**

A few explorations into this new science of **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**, which is nothing more than a replacement for Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
- SEO had its own robots.txt file
- GEO has its own llms.txt file

As an actor who lost his voice-dubbing job to AI told me: *"You better deal with AI before AI deals with you."*

**When AI Projects Lose Direction: Lessons from the Trenches**

After three months of radio silence on my blog, I had to confront an uncomfortable truth: my AI implementation project was off the rails. Here's what I learned about getting it back on track.

**The Real Problem Isn't Technical**
AI implementation quickly becomes an organizational challenge, not a technical one. It's a litmus test for how mature you are at managing creativity and resistance to change. The "human" obstacles‚Äîcontradictory orders, intellectual laziness, comfort zones‚Äîmatter more than the tech stack.

**AI + Automation: The Inevitable Evolution**
We're not just implementing AI; we're automating white-collar cognitive work (consultants, developers, journalists, POs, lawyers). First the secondary tasks, then why not the main ones? This is digital transformation on steroids.

**From Theory to Practice**
I've moved from philosophical hand-wringing to hands-on experimentation with n8n, Ollama, and local LLMs. The shift is clear: search engines are dead, long live the LLM. But here's the catch‚Äîif AI chooses your words, it's choosing your expression, your thoughts.

**The Platformization Trap**
We're swimming in nudge theory: "If you don't have an AI agent, you'll soon be nothing." The ultra-rich think they're more competent simply because they can pay to see their ideas applied. But as one Austrian heiress put it: they believe they're at the center of society when they're actually on the margins.

**Bottom Line**
Less talk, more POCs. Fewer slides, more terminal. Practice anchors understanding. You better deal with AI before AI deals with you.
