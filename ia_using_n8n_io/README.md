**When AI Projects Lose Direction: Lessons from the Trenches**

After three months of radio silence on my blog, I had to confront an uncomfortable truth: my AI implementation project was off the rails. Here's what I learned about getting it back on track.

**The Real Problem Isn't Technical**
AI implementation quickly becomes an organizational challenge, not a technical one. It's a litmus test for how mature you are at managing creativity and resistance to change. The "human" obstacles—contradictory orders, intellectual laziness, comfort zones—matter more than the tech stack.

**AI + Automation: The Inevitable Evolution**
We're not just implementing AI; we're automating white-collar cognitive work (consultants, developers, journalists, POs, lawyers). First the secondary tasks, then why not the main ones? This is digital transformation on steroids.

**From Theory to Practice**
I've moved from philosophical hand-wringing to hands-on experimentation with n8n, Ollama, and local LLMs. The shift is clear: search engines are dead, long live the LLM. But here's the catch—if AI chooses your words, it's choosing your expression, your thoughts.

**The Platformization Trap**
We're swimming in nudge theory: "If you don't have an AI agent, you'll soon be nothing." The ultra-rich think they're more competent simply because they can pay to see their ideas applied. But as one Austrian heiress put it: they believe they're at the center of society when they're actually on the margins.

**Bottom Line**
Less talk, more POCs. Fewer slides, more terminal. Practice anchors understanding. You better deal with AI before AI deals with you.
