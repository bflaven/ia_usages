# AI as a Product: Losing and Finding the North Star

## Overview
A personal reflection on managing AI implementation projects, the challenges of maintaining strategic focus, and the practical realities of working with generative AI in a corporate environment.

## Key Themes

### 1. Losing the North Star
- Common occurrence in digital product projects, especially AI implementations
- Happens quarterly in the author's current AI implementation project
- Two-step pragmatic approach:
  - Figure out why the project is going off the rails
  - Identify ways to remedy the impending failure

### 2. IaaP™: AI as a Product
- Acronym: IaaP™ (AI as a Product) - mirrors SaaS/PaaS naming conventions
- Challenge: "AI is not a digital product like any other"
- AI becomes an organizational challenge rather than a technical one
- Serves as a litmus test for organizational maturity in managing creativity
- Real measure of resistance to change

### 3. Human Causes of Project Derailment
- Contradictory orders
- Intellectual laziness
- Comfort zones
- Procrastination
- Self-proclaimed experts exposed by AI's disruptive nature

### 4. The Importance of Honest Assessment
- First step to recovery: honest, objective assessment of the situation
- Writing as remedy: verbalizing obstacles, doubts, and fears objectively
- Avoid pointing fingers or blaming others
- Sometimes necessary to recognize definitive failure: "fail fast, fail cheap"
- Combine awareness with adjustments (brutal or delicate)

### 5. AI's Transformative Impact
- Unlike classic digital products, AI has additional unknown dimensions
- Doesn't just disrupt usage patterns—radically transforms them
- Generative AI works through mimicry, generating content faster (and sometimes better) than humans
- Mechanically competes with all content producers: POs, developers, journalists, etc.

### 6. Quality and Practice
- Mission: assess and improve editorial quality using LLM, prompts, and functional improvements
- Quality depends on:
  - Prompts and models
  - Technical and functional improvements
  - UX is crucial for adoption (nothing to do with AI itself)
- Example: generating titles with AI requires interaction capability ("retry") as much as good prompts

### 7. Personal Impact of AI Usage
- Degradation of language skills and cognitive abilities
- AI choosing words means AI choosing your expression
- AI dictates what you write, therefore what you think
- Author learning to type professionally to maintain writing ability
- Risk: job becomes waiting for AI to finish typing

### 8. AI and Digital Transformation
- AI is an additional step in digital transformation
- Automation of white-collar work and cognitive jobs
- Shift from secondary task automation to primary task automation
- Naming things creates awareness

### 9. Philosophical Digression: Confused Perception of AI
- The constant reinvention of capitalism + technology questions societal fundamentals
- Work, culture, learning, politics—our entire presence in the world
- Tech "feudals" and "tech lords" seeking efficient systems over democracy
- Cold rationality vs. uncertain, contradictory individuals

### 10. The Algorithmic Economy
- Sectors getting crushed by algorithmic economy
- Platformization and monopolistic mechanisms
- References: Palantir Foundry, Peter Thiel, René Girard, Ayn Rand
- Ultra-rich believe they're at society's center when they're on the margins

### 11. Platformization Mechanism
- Example: job seeking now requires LinkedIn, mobile phone, active social media
- Similarly with AI: "If you don't have an AI agent, you'll soon be nothing"
- "You better deal with AI before AI deals with you"
- Nudge theory: indirect suggestions influencing decisions
- Market reality shapes individuals, not the other way around

### 12. Personal LLM Usage
- Collapse of search engine usage observed in practice
- No more Google.com, occasionally DuckDuckGo
- "Ask AI" options everywhere: mlflow.org, GitHub, Le Monde with Perplexity
- Major shift in usage: "Search engines are dead, long live the LLM"
- Daily use of Claude, Mistral, ChatGPT, Deepseek, Perplexity, open-source LLMs
- Personal opinions on LLMs are anecdotal and likely irrelevant

### 13. Moving to Practice
- Time to explore practical cases with n8n and LLMs
- MCP concept importance
- Theory vs. practice: understanding comes from getting hands dirty
- Tinkering with n8n, chaining API calls, testing prompts
- Less talk, more POCs. Fewer slides, more terminal.

## Operational Focus
- Using Ollama and several LLMs
- Exploring n8n for automation POCs with AI
- Streamlit for calling prompts
- Implementing retry functionality to show results come from interaction, not just prompt/model evolution

## Author's Context
- Project manager/PO implementing AI within company
- Three months of blog silence (last post June 25, 2025)
- Getting "old" in the digital world, feeling somewhat left behind
- Pragmatic approach to problem-solving
- Focus on practice and discipline

## Key Takeaway
Acknowledging mistakes or failures is essential for progress. Move from theory to practice, from abstraction to concrete implementation.
