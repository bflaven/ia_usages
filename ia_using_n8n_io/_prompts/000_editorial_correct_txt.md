## INPUT_1


As the editor of a personal blog, can you revise this text in English?
1. Correcting mistakes and choosing simpler wording
2. Restructure if needed and vamidate the html code e.g H1, H2... etc
3. Maintaining a slightly ironic and "direct and frank" tone
4. Keep and print the text as HTML in a tag ```html``` as it will go to a wordpress post
5. Give me three titles and put them in comment in ```<!-- TITLE: -->
5. Give me a bunch of keywords in a comma separate list so I can cut and paste into WordPres in ```<!-- KWS: -->```


```html

<!-- put you html here -->

```
