## INPUT_1
As a python expert, write the streamlit script named `streamlit_query_ollama.py` that will go on the top of the script `query_ollama.py` and `config.py`so as a user I can update the values `cms_section_keywords_list`, `lang`, `content`.

You must find for the variables`cms_section_keywords_list`, `lang`, `content` the proper type of streamlit element to simplify the UX of the user. Like I said before, the main objective remains to help me to update the values into the file config.py to launch the script easily with new values but this time through a streamlit application. 



## INPUT_2
Ok you enable the edit of the `config.py` can you add the save of the old `config.py` with a named like `config_[timestamp].py` and save the new config into `config.py`

## INPUT_2
Ok you have integrated the save can you launch directly from streamlit the `query_ollama.py` with the new config.
