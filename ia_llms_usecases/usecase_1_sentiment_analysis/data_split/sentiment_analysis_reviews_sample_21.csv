401,B001ELL6O8,A1JM25M2PSVPXE,G. Erikson,1,4,3,1186790400,Love the product disappointed in the shipping.,I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.
402,B001ELL6O8,A12T0F58OKHCIW,"fishaholic ""hearyeethis""",1,4,1,1184025600,poor item packaging,This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
403,B001ELL6O8,A2APBHKZCMD6DO,X,0,6,1,1207353600,Awful,"Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad."
404,B006CGURWM,A3F5EUYWKVWPJ6,southernboy,0,0,1,1342915200,disappointing,"Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable."
405,B00250I0EG,A2VJBGSGUC78FB,"Joy L. Breegle ""Joy B.""",1,1,5,1258156800,Great Healthy Snack,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
406,B000C21OOM,A1T61QP7QHYBRQ,an honest reviewer,6,7,5,1199059200,Sweet and Soothing,"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."
407,B003D4O92K,A2KTYAKU1PEVCI,D. E. Leslie,3,3,5,1288396800,minty flavor,"This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used."
408,B003D4O92K,A3K24YL6ORL11F,Calizian,0,0,5,1339545600,Ingredients take about 2 seconds to read,"This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better."
409,B001IZM8A6,AVI998S4IX2Y1,"Melissa N. Connor ""rare maven""",1,1,5,1257897600,A Fantastic & Healthy Product,"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !"
410,B001IZM8A6,A2ANZVA56T7RAG,Patricia,0,0,5,1343260800,Great product,"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon."
411,B0089PI9OC,ARYNM1E978YX8,Bill,0,0,5,1341360000,Excellent tea!,"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box."
412,B00061KYVI,A28RMYGO9RGA0K,marilyn,0,0,5,1328140800,french's roast'n bags,"i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market."
413,B00061KYVI,A3JE18D4XD2PYF,pattymelt,0,0,5,1282521600,best roast ever,This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!
414,B00061KYVI,A29ZSRDOYVO735,"Robert Ames ""Spenser_man""",0,0,5,1264809600,Franch's is the best,It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.<br /><br />This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.
415,B003XV5LHK,A197O1VYM9B8A3,LDA,0,0,5,1302307200,Double the pleasure!,"If you like Oreo's or the Oreo cakester, then you've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better."
416,B005WU7V00,A3UV9TOZW3XXPV,tacoland,1,1,5,1336521600,VERY GOOD! Great taste and easy for a single guy!,"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!"
417,B005CFC9XY,A250IZTJ5UN2EI,Ian Harmer,0,0,5,1344816000,An acquired taste!,"The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!"
418,B000SEJ842,A2IJOBHJXEZSS2,mosslake,0,0,1,1312934400,Look elsewhere for your whole grains,"A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage."
419,B004X8TK8I,A3U2QAY7SVE9AI,W. Smith,0,0,5,1344988800,Hey!,Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!
420,B004X8TK8I,A3GIMXLOEPFJBV,Samuel Spade,0,0,4,1342396800,These are Famous for a reason.,These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.<br /><br />I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!
