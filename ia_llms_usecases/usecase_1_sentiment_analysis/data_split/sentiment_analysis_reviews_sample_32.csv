621,B000G6RYNE,A2PYL0PSX5MQYQ,JS from Maryland,5,7,2,1306281600,Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!"
622,B000G6RYNE,A2J4K5SCKZH38C,T. Nelson,5,7,1,1297900800,Expired stock,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
623,B000G6RYNE,ADS5APY1NKTL4,"D. Pawl ""Dani""",5,7,5,1175040000,these potato chips are yummy....,"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store.  The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
624,B000G6RYNE,AKGQ6RM68SQY1,"Catherine Diane ""CDI""",2,3,1,1336521600,ONLY awful because SOMETIMES they are awful,"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
625,B000G6RYNE,A3TA1UJWRJF9NC,jschristian44,2,3,4,1283472000,4 Stars for price and taste,"I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars."
626,B000G6RYNE,A3M174IC0VXOS2,Gail Cooke,2,3,5,1245024000,"CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND ROBUST","We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."
627,B000G6RYNE,A2FVD05Z2FYW1P,J. Silva,2,3,4,1243987200,Tangy and delicious snack,"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5."
628,B000G6RYNE,A3M2VGWFJGRUOH,Eco-Friendly Interior Designer,2,3,5,1217980800,Best Chip,"Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the ""fancy"" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!"
629,B000G6RYNE,A28HKCWJ7YF2AI,Punim,2,3,3,1198195200,Not low salt,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
630,B000G6RYNE,A36QQYEW0AMJEO,"Desperado ""Ron""",2,3,5,1193443200,Best Chips I've Ever Tasted,"Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high."
631,B000G6RYNE,A1IVFBJA9KAI1M,Shane Martin,2,3,4,1191369600,Tasty!,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"
632,B000G6RYNE,A16Q0OV7CIPQC0,Steffanee Holt,0,0,5,1350345600,Love the smaller bags!,My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
633,B000G6RYNE,A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,nonpareil,0,0,3,1347408000,Things you need to know,"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems."
634,B000G6RYNE,A1I29JSIGJNWKH,"John G. Edwards ""homiedog""",0,0,5,1347062400,I made a mistake.....,"This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  ยง homiedog ยง"
635,B000G6RYNE,A28870VSBU9LDQ,Brian Bean,0,0,3,1344902400,Ok but Miss Vickie's Are Better,Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.
636,B000G6RYNE,A2Y0FKOY6WE0NQ,Meg,0,0,3,1338163200,"Do they have to ""bite back""?","I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though."
637,B000G6RYNE,ACJW2YSBG2HA1,i am me,0,0,4,1336694400,These chips are awesome if not best but....,I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.
638,B000G6RYNE,A1J5HHOPXZ6UNF,Chris,0,0,4,1336608000,kettle chips,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
639,B000G6RYNE,A2W1A5GK4A03ZT,"M. Gonzales ""emelgee""",0,0,5,1336262400,GREAT DEAL,I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
640,B001EPPFGO,A1RZ4VH27NLDGS,"Jeremy Morgan ""A good book on your shelf is a...",0,0,5,1334534400,What a great tea at this price,"This is a delicious tea!<br /><br />I'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.<br /><br />The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.<br /><br />This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I don't add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2-3 minutes it's ready.<br /><br />Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick!"
