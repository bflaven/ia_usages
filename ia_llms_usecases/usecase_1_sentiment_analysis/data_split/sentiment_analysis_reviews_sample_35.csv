681,B000G6MBX2,A2MIJOZVTWEXP2,"TG ""Tigris""",4,5,5,1187740800,My favorite chips from Kettle!!,Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet! Very hard to find in New Jersey. Can not have just one bag around!!
682,B000G6MBX2,A4AYT6I29WTPY,"Chip Lover ""Leisa""",4,5,5,1158537600,"Amazing Taste, Best Chip Ever!",I can't believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted.
683,B000G6MBX2,A1UDFKEKTO70NX,Tiffany,1,1,4,1245110400,tasty,"These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.<br /><br />The only downside: the spice is minimal."
684,B000G6MBX2,A471XPKNUEJGU,Joe133,1,1,4,1219536000,Plocky's Sweet Smokey Chipotle Whole Grain Tortill...,I think Plocky's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.
685,B000G6MBX2,A3UCO7B9HP42BG,Denise Graner,1,1,5,1217203200,Yummy chips,"These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall."
686,B000G6MBX2,A28A3KLKV22OAJ,C. Young,1,1,5,1215043200,Tasty!,A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :)
687,B000G6MBX2,A1WX42M589VAMQ,Mir,3,4,5,1209686400,So Faboo: Dangerous for those prone to Chips Binges!!!,"I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir"
688,B000G6MBX2,ARUQJLJBXS88,Karen E. Emanuel,3,4,5,1184371200,The spice will grow!,"At first you think that these chips aren't all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good!"
689,B000G6MBX2,A3MKD1JZEYH8J3,"P. Werwie ""Punchneedle Chick""",2,3,5,1256342400,The best tortilla chips I have ever eaten!!,"I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon."
690,B000G6MBX2,A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,"K. Stuckey ""kateling""",2,3,5,1202169600,Such an excellent chip,"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!"
691,B000G6MBX2,AK5DB61C13CN7,Seraxia,0,0,1,1344384000,WRONG FLAVOR - got Country BBQ instead of Chili Chipotle,"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for."
692,B000G6MBX2,A3AIHN7XBD816P,Kathryn Waldrup,0,0,5,1284681600,Great,"We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale."
693,B000G6MBX2,AWZG8HXBE8PNB,doraima,0,0,5,1278633600,Plocky's Rice and Beans Tortilla Chips,"I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera."
694,B000G6MBX2,A3QAZDJ7NYH2C6,M. Esmail,0,0,5,1265500800,Huge fan of these chips!,"I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. Used to get them at Henry's in San Diego, CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since. Running out of them constantly!"
695,B000G6MBX2,A2OPEDFVLL22TP,"B Healthy ""Healthy eater""",0,0,4,1256169600,Plocky's tortilla chips--tasty and healthy,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!
696,B000G6MBX2,A2M7DO3ICXZWF1,"Mary K. Herman ""Marushka""",0,0,5,1250035200,Plocky's Three Grain Tortilla Chips,"We love these. Can't always get them in local stores, they don't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture."
697,B000G6MBX2,A1KTR92SDR33GZ,"P. Herbert ""cal_herbie""",0,0,4,1248652800,"Tasty, but make sure you have gum","These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day."
698,B000G6MBX2,A1DMR4TXV10JBB,"A. Chrzanowski ""Dwarf Mama""",0,0,5,1246665600,Don't stop carrying these chips,"The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good."
699,B000G6MBX2,A15UN7OK3WRFXE,Rich Wang,0,0,5,1244678400,OM NOM NOM NOM!,"These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags."
700,B000G6MBX2,A31UITXO8QXG3H,Jay M. Clayton,0,0,5,1243987200,delicious and healthy,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again."
