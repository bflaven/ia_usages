They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up!"
282,B001D07IPG,AQX8FF2YCO3J7,"Little D, Nigel, and Oliver's mom",0,0,5,1247529600,Excellent Taste,This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I'll eat the whole bag.
283,B001D07IPG,A27UE9HJRZ22YI,"Louie's Mom ""Compulsive Reader""",0,1,1,1280880000,Over priced chips and lack rice taste,"I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a ""good"" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have ""Masa corn flour"" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste."
284,B000H13270,A3MBRJ5X24GXM9,sadhaka,3,4,5,1283817600,Rotel saves me on a daily basis,"I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird ""tin can"" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product."
285,B000H13270,A3J6I70Z9Q0HRX,Lindey H. Magee,1,3,5,1261785600,"it's fabulous, but *not* from amazon!",the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!
286,B000H13270,A1YLOZQKBX3J1S,"R. Lee Dailey ""Lee_Dailey""",1,4,3,1221177600,too expensive,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.<br /><br />as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
287,B000H13270,AVQIRN6E7J7UA,imdebra,0,4,3,1280534400,Not mild enough for me lol,"Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a ""baby-mouth"" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though."
288,B001UJEN6C,A1XM65S80UQ2MD,Joseph Kagan,13,13,5,1276214400,Great Natural Energy,"This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results."
289,B001UJEN6C,AFUMZHRZJG0H0,Wonder Woman 89,6,6,5,1280188800,I like this stuff,"I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon. I was drinking one 5 hour energy, usually extra strength, each day. It worked well, but gave me a jittery feeling, almost headachy but not quite. My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical, but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesn't give me that jittery almost-headache feeling.<br /><br />I don't mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton (mmm). And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!<br /><br />And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!"
290,B001UJEN6C,AIW47KAXVTR0X,"C. Williams ""will5927""",7,8,5,1268092800,Great Energy,I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!
291,B001UJEN6C,A1R2P21ZYNJCFJ,"Mare Laden ""Mare""",6,7,3,1258675200,Not sure,"I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others."
292,B001UJEN6C,A37AO20OXS51QA,"Roderic Rinehart ""Roderic""",3,3,5,1311292800,"The best energy shot out there, smooth and organic!","If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.<br /><br />Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.<br /><br />Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value."
293,B001UJEN6C,A3R6W1FEYDNT8V,R. Lewis,3,3,5,1299024000,"Fantastic, natural energy","I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!<br /><br />I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.<br /><br />I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try."
294,B001UJEN6C,A2VBZOK3SVSDWA,Jennifer Gray,3,3,5,1294790400,Way better than Guayaki!,"I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)"
295,B001UJEN6C,AREOHWLWVX0A8,John Erikson,5,6,3,1259971200,Doesn't taste that good but provides you the energy,"I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable."
296,B001UJEN6C,ADWJAJZTHNYN6,D. J. Lawhead,2,2,5,1322697600,Rocket in a Bottle,"I've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. As a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.<br /><br />She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.<br /><br />She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.<br /><br />Woot!"
297,B001UJEN6C,A3UD9G34YLWVXE,Thezwomann,2,2,4,1322265600,This stuff works!!!,"The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. It's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!!"
298,B001UJEN6C,A2Y4IWY1ZXLXH8,mase310,1,1,5,1335139200,Favorite energy shot and all natural too!,"I've tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what I'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years."
299,B001UJEN6C,AHAX3RWULQD6T,Kevin D. Schoeninger,1,1,5,1334793600,natural energy boost,"If you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters."
300,B001UJEN6C,A2LFHPZFG1OHBZ,Joanna Capello-Paul,2,3,5,1320451200,Best energy shot I have ever tasted!,"I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!"
