162,B000ITVLE2,A1K37I9HWF3SAI,James R. Mckinney,1,1,3,1349222400,Not the greatest tasting..,"I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me."
163,B000ITVLE2,A6Y8N2GHDH0ZO,Matty,0,0,4,1348272000,Not Bad,"I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal."
164,B000ITVLE2,A5X6PJANY4XW4,"Tcat Houser ""A Customer""",0,0,5,1348099200,"Right size, taste","I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor."
165,B000ITVLE2,ARTBQH9WOZTIV,"Billy Wilson ""amzrview""",0,4,1,1269216000,Tasteless but low calorie,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,Amy,1,1,5,1338508800,This stuff is sooooo good!,"I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)"
167,B003TQQKFQ,A2QHQM3HHFUSHG,Catherine Lea,2,3,5,1334102400,Best Stuff Ever,"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!"
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,NikkiBast,1,1,1,1345420800,Very Low quality,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,TampaBayGal,1,1,1,1350086400,Not Banana Runts,"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor."
170,B0064KO0BU,AAV3AEI6YSYA2,sue,0,0,3,1345766400,Banana Heads Not Banana Runts,"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope."
171,B0064KO0BU,A104Y49ZQ4CYJ2,"H. Adams ""hollya""",0,0,5,1344816000,Worked great!,"I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag."
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,"A. Martin ""tony_fourbu""",3,3,5,1283299200,Ricore forever,"I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out."
173,B001IUKD76,A2K8UBI64T0BM8,A. Carriglio,3,3,5,1262131200,Delicious!,"I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,Pink Dandy Chatter,0,0,5,1344902400,"Fluffy, Soft, Delicious and Sugary Sweet","I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really ""takes the cake"" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,Jerald,5,6,4,1280793600,Great but not as good as it was back in the day as a teen,I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.
176,B0025VRCJY,A2VYRRDJN2UKWB,"Dario Quinonez ""aprilkid""",1,1,5,1299974400,EXCELLENT LEMON JUICE,"One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it."
177,B0025VRCJY,A2ACUGNVT36JYX,Lyannah,0,0,5,1325203200,Great Product,This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.
178,B0025VRCJY,A3F8JQ5J29GWUV,qv240,0,0,5,1315526400,Handy,"Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with."
179,B0025VRCJY,A3L9ZT7SRJYLVH,"JDTexan ""JDTexan""",0,2,4,1293926400,ReaLemon Juice from Amazon.,"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!"
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,Tom Falcon,8,8,4,1314316800,"relaxing, almost like something you smoke","Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff."
