264,B000LKZK7C,A25YQEBU2FAD3M,Scott Dixon,4,5,3,1295222400,Manufacturing Problems Diminish Product,"I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw."

266,B000LKZK7C,A1H9VU1FACOXLN,LK,1,1,5,1228089600,Sugar in the raw,Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!
267,B000LKZK7C,AWJ1Z81HHB0MY,Zots,1,1,5,1217635200,Sugar in the raw,Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.
268,B000LKZK7C,A2NP8RNW9T5BQF,A. Brazhnykova,0,0,1,1343952000,Lie!!!!,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."
269,B000LKZK7C,A2JRK3K99168A1,djn,0,0,4,1336089600,It's sugar..,"It's just sugar in the raw, it's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it's suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable."
270,B000LKZK7C,A1L4RDILGM7D9E,Paula,0,0,4,1312934400,Excellent but not perfect,"This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer."
271,B000LKZK7C,A2VUB6YYTF234O,Anel Lopez,0,0,4,1302739200,Good product,"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again."
272,B000LKZK7C,A21BLUM0I2Y3MW,Chipper,0,0,5,1297814400,You'll never use white sugar again.,"This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and you'll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.<br /><br />The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found."
273,B000LKZK7C,A1VKNACW03M5H7,Patilo,0,0,3,1296950400,Thanks for the review Scott,"I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content ""Sugar in the Raw"".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop."
274,B000LKZK7C,A2582KMXLK2P06,B. E Jackson,0,0,5,1296777600,great,I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.
275,B000LKZK7C,A34HSMRAQY5XKX,"Nori Silverrage ""Nori""",0,0,5,1285718400,Awesome Sugar!,"Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as ""regular"" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff."
276,B000LKZK7C,AUUWUS51SMMT4,R. Symansky,0,0,4,1260835200,Great product - weak packaging,"Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other ""natural"" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the ""natural"" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag."
277,B000LKZK7C,A1YZV2UY0QDZTX,"Loves to Cook ""Loves""",1,2,5,1253750400,Excellent!,Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!
278,B001D07IPG,A3QN14A5DGUA0U,J. Kraayenbrink,0,0,5,1343692800,Excellent for G/F,"Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another ""binder"" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!"
279,B001D07IPG,ABHXONN9HSUZI,AmandaEve011,0,0,5,1315353600,Amazing!,Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....
280,B001D07IPG,A3OM7Q1IVAGLUW,Pertigal,0,0,5,1275436800,Very tasty chips!,"So many ""healthy"" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway."
