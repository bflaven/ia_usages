121,B003SE19UK,A3A52DETIFZNZS,Sarah Wilson,4,4,5,1309564800,Great food.,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select."
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,Cynthia G. Pate,2,2,5,1330992000,Perfect Cat Food For Older Cats!,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,Alfbo,1,1,5,1313107200,Good for Feline UTI,"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me."
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,Anne Kirkwood,1,1,5,1292544000,Palatable and healthy,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters."
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,PurpleGreen,0,0,5,1349049600,Healthy & They LOVE It!,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
126,B003SE19UK,A1QAJ948PN36II,Winter Green,0,0,5,1341964800,Wonderful food - perfect for allergic kitties,"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also."
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,PMG1,0,0,5,1334188800,Holistic select cat food,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,Austin H.,4,4,4,1325808000,Tastes great. Love Hot & Spicy. Bad price here.,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart."
129,B003OB0IB8,A3NVZTGPORNPRW,B. Pearce,4,4,5,1314489600,My favorite ramen,"I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!"
130,B003OB0IB8,A28D854VMOEHGX,Benny,3,3,3,1329436800,It burns!,"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon."
131,B003OB0IB8,AISIYS3D2EAOX,RTyst,1,1,5,1330473600,Amazing to the last bite.,"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in."
132,B003OB0IB8,A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU,luckybabe,2,3,2,1323820800,Not for me,"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn."
133,B003OB0IB8,A56HS2VNURVJ0,"J. Espinoza ""jchav1980""",0,0,5,1343606400,Great spicy flavor,I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.
134,B003OB0IB8,AOTEC8KEH8JGN,Seth S Moyers,0,0,5,1334880000,Great value and convenient ramen,"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale."
135,B003OB0IB8,A1D0URD0AL237J,Mother of Pearl,0,0,5,1334620800,great flavor,i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
136,B003OB0IB8,A2BZNXMV0LC7OE,Alanna,0,0,4,1333756800,"Tastes great, but is cheaper locally.","I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store."
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,Sarah,0,0,5,1349740800,Tastes awesome & looks beautiful,"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)"
138,B002SRYRE8,A21E0OJ4DSKXNA,Smileface,0,0,5,1342051200,Happy Face,Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,"Gettin Real ""gettin real""",0,0,5,1329177600,Simply the BEST!,"I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down."
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,Mrs. J. Todd,0,0,5,1268265600,Excellent Product/Life Saver,"My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!"
