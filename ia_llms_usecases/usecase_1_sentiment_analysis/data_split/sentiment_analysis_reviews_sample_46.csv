901,B000ER6YO0,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,Citizen John,6,6,4,1255651200,Dessert to Them.  But is it Nutritional Enough?,"My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
902,B000ER6YO0,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,Citizen John,5,5,3,1255651200,Repeated deliveries of broken jars.  Great product though,"I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.<br /><br />The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.<br /><br />I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
903,B000ER6YO0,A6LAMY7Z10BBJ,Amazon Shopper,4,4,4,1286928000,"Good flavor, too runny though","Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one."
904,B000ER6YO0,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,Citizen John,3,3,3,1255651200,12% Protein and 50% Vitamin A,"Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
905,B000ER6YO0,A1K4TZD6TPLKOC,Lisa Schaal Robinson,1,1,5,1337731200,Baby Lilly says 2 thumbs up!,"My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars."
906,B000ER6YO0,ABO66JJKQBGID,Brianne,1,1,5,1324252800,Earth's Best Rice & Lentil dinner,"Its my daughter's favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices."
907,B000ER6YO0,A1UTKYFGM2ITLU,B. Citron,1,1,1,1321142400,Plastic in the food!,"Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business."
908,B000ER6YO0,AWBKE3QTB3BWX,Nessie,1,1,4,1315958400,My baby's favorite 2nd stage food so far and great for constipation!,"I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein."
909,B000ER6YO0,ACM3Z9NLSE8S9,Tracy,1,1,5,1314835200,Sons Favorite Dinner!!!,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far."
910,B000ER6YO0,A7INGAHQIWQ1,Samylee00,1,1,5,1306972800,No Issues,"I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all."
911,B000ER6YO0,A3TUTIAVU7Q2E2,AV,1,1,3,1302307200,Too thin,Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.
912,B000ER6YO0,A3MA4VWLFOCJ41,ARMorris,1,1,5,1289865600,A great place to start,"I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend."
913,B000ER6YO0,A26L4JZZ9C1GT5,Alison Denton Jones,1,1,4,1287964800,good for you but not best flavor,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
914,B000ER6YO0,AOIW6NFHHPT78,"Sarathetis ""Sarathetis""",1,1,5,1284336000,A favorite!,Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found!
915,B000ER6YO0,AB0BXP1IKDBIA,TreGemellini,1,1,1,1278892800,Runny and odd-tasting,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."
916,B000ER6YO0,AH5GCNH82ZU0C,"*~*~*Valley*~*~* ""Val""",1,1,3,1277337600,Too runny...,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick."
917,B000ER6YO0,A3T7LFZQGL24A5,JuliaB,0,0,4,1350259200,"Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others","My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems."
918,B000ER6YO0,AYAU6OMJ81Q7Z,Happinesslikeabutterfly,0,0,5,1348012800,Great stuff,This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).
919,B000ER6YO0,AXKXFB6C9Z9BH,JFMile,0,0,5,1346803200,Son loves it,My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
920,B000ER6YO0,A1KB35ZYR2Z9RL,Ellen123,0,0,5,1341532800,Love it,"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price."
