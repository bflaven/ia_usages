141,B001GVISJW,ARS5Q7LR6HWPG,"N. Pine ""pcone""",0,0,4,1314489600,Nice snack,I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.
142,B001GVISJW,A2YIO225BTKVPU,"Angel_Boy ""Treat the people around you the wa...",0,0,4,1301788800,Good Licorice,Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,Karon Dixon,0,0,5,1285804800,I love these!!!!!!!!,"I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!"
144,B001GVISJW,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,0,0,5,1269129600,Great for the kids!,"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!"
145,B001GVISJW,A281387UUS2IN5,Beantown Jim,0,1,3,1271548800,Bite sized,"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same."
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,MarkD,2,2,5,1240012800,Sweet with a nice kick!,"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,Barbie,2,2,2,1224633600,BROKEN BOTTLE BOTTOMS!,"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little ""stuffing"" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found ""none"" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF ""STUFF"" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S."
148,B0017I8UME,ATBE88PKKQTRA,Matthew R Lehmkuhler,0,0,5,1344384000,Love the salsa!!,This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.
149,B0064KU9HO,AJFIH0DZYJF7T,Lisa Barton,0,0,3,1350345600,Ehhh...,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
150,B0037ZFEW4,ABTKZKAWOK4DC,huntersgun,3,3,5,1326153600,awesome cornmeal,"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor."
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,Teeebooo,0,0,5,1341446400,GREAT marinade!,"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!"
152,B00374XSVY,A2PW7DRW757OL0,Chris,0,0,5,1335052800,Awesome stuff,Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores
153,B005P0HHGK,AISCBGJRPPZ5G,"KT ""loves to read""",0,0,4,1326585600,tastes good,Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.
154,B002HQAXUW,A17ESTP5T7T1PH,Bumbeda1,1,1,1,1324944000,Rip off Price,"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy."
155,B000SV90J8,A1CY94Z8YWQV12,Karas M. Stewart,1,1,5,1267401600,JELL-O,AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,pianolover,0,0,5,1323648000,Great flavor of Jell-o.,"I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!"
157,B0036VM05I,AUIVXYS8E4DEX,Dr. Christopher Lee,1,1,5,1327708800,Great Deal,What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
158,B0036VM05I,A335SFRERY214N,"D. Melo ""Character Connoisseur""",0,0,5,1349481600,Great tasting sea salt WITH iodine,"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely."
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"Louie Arrighi ""Lou da Joo""",17,19,5,1260057600,tastes very fresh,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway."
160,B000ITVLE2,A395S4RA1X7BFB,Pen_Name123,3,3,5,1315872000,Simple but good,I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.
