982,B004DTNJU2,A1C3LSDRPLFZ62,Hank Schwartz,3,3,5,1297814400,new to rooibos tea,"I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I've read about."
983,B004DTNJU2,A4D9AIUP1NNIY,HotRod,0,0,5,1341705600,Tasted better than loose leaf rooibos,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny."
984,B004DTNJU2,A1YQORA01YBBLS,MD_JD,0,0,5,1325635200,Best matcha quality and price,"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase."

It doesn't compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!"

988,B006F2NYI2,A36GDATSF85X7W,Matt Waz,2,2,5,1326499200,Awesome Sauce,"This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce."
989,B006F2NYI2,A36WE3X9G0DZUZ,Gale P,2,2,5,1324339200,love this hot sauce,"I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.'s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, It's so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and party's. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon."

I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!
991,B006F2NYI2,AFN9QJ7IE89N4,C Bonner,2,2,5,1323993600,Love This Stuff,"They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It's hot, but not without flavor.  I don't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce."
992,B006F2NYI2,AN85IOOEI9IYB,Jdub,2,2,5,1323734400,Best sauce around,"I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up."
993,B006F2NYI2,AHSURYHM6ZZXC,nuttmeg,2,2,5,1323734400,Tasty hot sauce!,This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
994,B006F2NYI2,A1KFUVZ3BZ59R1,merplinger,2,2,5,1323734400,Best all around hot sauce,So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
995,B006F2NYI2,A1T5CH6SHV989P,a biemold,2,2,5,1323734400,best hot sauce around,"absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!"

I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium & habenero. Kind of like a ""HIS & HERS package"". Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work."

998,B006F2NYI2,A3G313KLWDG3PW,kefka82,1,1,5,1324252800,this sauce is the shiznit,"this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it"
999,B006F2NYI2,A3NIDDT7E7JIFW,V. B. Brookshaw,1,2,1,1336089600,Not Hot,"Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it"
1000,B006F2NYI2,A132DJVI37RB4X,Scottdrum,2,5,2,1332374400,"Not hot, not habanero","I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum"
