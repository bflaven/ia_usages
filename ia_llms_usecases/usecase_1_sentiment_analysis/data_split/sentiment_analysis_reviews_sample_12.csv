221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,K. Kwan,0,0,5,1350864000,A fragrant tea,"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label ""Imperial Blend"" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea."
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,Sophia T,0,0,5,1310688000,Best Ahmad Tea,"I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication."
223,B001EO5ZMO,A3JP1UJAF8YY0F,Irish Stu,0,0,5,1308009600,My favorite tea,"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too."
224,B001EO5ZMO,A8XEEORIXJNZL,Joseph Emmanuel,0,1,5,1330819200,Best tea ever!,This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.
225,B001EO5ZMO,A3A4GAPXRX5SHM,markiz,1,3,2,1282435200,Not a real tea,Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I don't.
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,Tiff D,0,0,4,1264377600,DELICIOUS,"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.<br /><br />The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins."

Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy."
228,B007JFV6RK,A3LCMQ815MBJW9,Patty,1,1,5,1338163200,The Best,"Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar!<br />Half mix ,half clamato!"

230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,Victoria Brown,0,0,1,1345593600,Not Good,This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
231,B003SO503C,A2ODZ3CH8PMYTL,Nanette,0,0,5,1347235200,Love this tea!,"I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long."
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,Bold Consumer,0,0,5,1333843200,Really Nice Taste!,"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one."

234,B003ZFXJDW,A2KPPGFMPD20M6,Linda Albert,0,0,1,1343692800,Furniture Polish Taste,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
235,B003ZFXJDW,AJ94Y22SUFCGU,Gwenhwyfar,0,1,5,1303257600,Big tub o' salt,"These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything. You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this."
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,Dandelion,0,0,2,1302307200,"Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!","The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor."
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,jackman,0,0,5,1341878400,Eukanuba puppy small breed dog food,"This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock."
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,B. Barnett,0,0,4,1331251200,High Quality... But it gave my dog wicked gas..,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better."
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,Pinkhat,0,0,5,1330387200,Great tasting green tea and such a great deal.,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
