804,B004S0AQHA,A3AV5XEJ25KVF4,"Castlecat ""castlecat""",9,10,3,1310774400,"Overpriced, Even on Gold Box","This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be."
805,B004S0AQHA,A1JYQTN8CN3CY2,JC in ABQ,9,10,3,1310428800,Even at $15 seems a little overpriced.,"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though."
806,B004S0AQHA,A3R66N9FR8HMJ7,Kdpsnake,2,2,5,1311120000,Quick arrival great basket!,Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected.
807,B004S0AQHA,A1ZYO3FOEXVCJS,Catherine Odegard,1,1,5,1312329600,Adorable basket-makes nice presentation,"Received very quickly and extremely well packaged.  Since this is a smaller sized basket, it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea, for self or just to have to hand.  Very nicely assembled with attention to detail."
808,B0030C9A60,A3BH49ZKESHDID,Fred Camfield,1,1,5,1290038400,Specialty party item,"These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called ""jello shots,"" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups."
809,B0030C9A60,A23WVMQ6J7BZ61,B. Rickerd,0,0,5,1334793600,Delicious!,I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party! It was a big hit. They are high quality and a good buy.

811,B0030C9A60,A30MMUR0DMHYCG,M. Veenstra,0,0,5,1324771200,chocolate liquor cups,"Delicious chocolate cups, each in its own aluminum holder.  I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line.<br />Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping the<br />liquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product."

813,B004ET7MG8,AH7LB9HXLYL25,william,2,2,4,1327104000,has a very good flavor,"strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isn't bad either. My next pick would be blueberry"
814,B004ET7MG8,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,"C. F. Hill ""CFH""",3,4,2,1272240000,Odd Fake Flavor - Not Recommended,"Trident ""Strawberry Twist"" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets ""stringy"" fairly quickly.<br /><br />I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
815,B004ET7MG8,A33VG37SOTA0YS,Daxvieor,0,0,3,1345507200,"Good sugarless gum, with stronger gum for better bubble blowing than other sugarless gums","Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time."
816,B004ET7MG8,AI7W7S3IK45KV,"Young Professional ""Becca P""",0,0,5,1344211200,Great Gum,I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!
817,B004ET7MG8,A3THFR9NVPSUIP,D. S. MD,2,4,5,1293926400,Delicious IMO and.... helps weight loss,"If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- ""De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est"".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight."

After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!"

When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?"
