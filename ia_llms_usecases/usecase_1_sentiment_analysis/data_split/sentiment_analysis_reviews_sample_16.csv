I love it."
302,B001UJEN6C,AMYAHFQZI19LS,longlivedave,0,0,5,1345680000,Tested by a trucker,I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.
303,B001UJEN6C,A28VTF9FQ42SBV,jeremygiesel,0,0,5,1344729600,Good Stuff,"Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink."
304,B001UJEN6C,A2H03V8PAZDU9J,LMPGAP,0,0,5,1339200000,Great energy drink without artificial ingredients,"I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant."
305,B001UJEN6C,AUXHG88OYWCGM,Nicholas Wagner,0,0,5,1333411200,"Flavor getting better, energy is great","I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots."
306,B001UJEN6C,ATN552TF5V40Z,Lh,1,5,1,1326758400,So awful I can barely describe,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
307,B003EMU7EU,A3DSWITPB6NBT5,benvenutofam,0,0,4,1287619200,could use only once,"I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)"

I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more."
310,B003YDP5PA,AFLLCB3F28N6A,FL-Gal,2,2,5,1320451200,Fantastic!,"This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend"
311,B003YDP5PA,A3T8PIRVS2LX4P,MLadyJ,1,1,5,1305072000,WOW,"I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a ""pasta type"" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!"

I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container."
313,B002X9JNYU,AVPSSODZIDABZ,HELfromBL,1,3,1,1323388800,what quantity is it!,I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?
314,B001EPQ0J0,A2RXRKRI8YSQWQ,Susan Toy,0,0,5,1341014400,Very Good Coffee,"I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try."
315,B001EPQ0J0,A2KADAQBR8NG80,"Maggi ""Mags""",0,0,5,1290384000,Very Tasty,"I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both."
316,B001EPQ0J0,A2L3IECPFB956F,D. Alger,0,0,5,1268265600,Excellent coffee,"This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it."
317,B000O9Y62A,A137DV4YVGWDCR,M. AIMINO,0,0,5,1332460800,Hot!,"It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing."
318,B000O9Y62A,A89KN0ADLUNPW,Scott E. Packard,0,0,5,1250208000,Hot and delicious,"I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say ""That's hot!"".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales."
