502,B000G6RYNE,A3TX8RH943OLBM,annie,3,5,2,1214006400,salt and vinegar chips,It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
503,B000G6RYNE,A3L4OZ0U0A5UDH,Linda Mullings,1,2,5,1349136000,Delicious!!,Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
504,B000G6RYNE,A2OEUROGZDTXUJ,J. Graves,1,2,4,1327968000,I like them.,"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me..."
505,B000G6RYNE,A30H2335OM7RD6,"apoem ""apoem""",1,2,5,1316649600,Love Kettle Chips,"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy."
506,B000G6RYNE,A2SYKMR242D0X6,Summer,1,2,5,1292544000,Best unsalted chips,These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.
507,B000G6RYNE,A27YPCR3ZXWVFE,Tiny Tim,1,2,5,1287792000,So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.,"Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar..."
508,B000G6RYNE,A39Y59C6FTC0GL,Christine,1,2,2,1247788800,"Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor!",I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
509,B000G6RYNE,A3I5AT1101AS3A,Nikolette Tripp,1,2,1,1233360000,Maybe the worst chips ever.,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
510,B000G6RYNE,A22LENLDTGQIU7,R. Yamaoka,4,7,1,1252713600,Surprise 1  It's different...,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite."
511,B000G6RYNE,A2ZCD6KO2YY9IZ,A. Crawford,2,4,5,1200700800,Tasty,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
512,B000G6RYNE,A2C18CH1YC6BYT,Sophie,0,1,4,1314403200,Crisp,"I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be."
513,B000G6RYNE,A2M8JQ3AME7878,"Tom Z. ""tzphotos.com""",0,1,3,1297036800,Vinegar... Not my taste!,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
514,B000G6RYNE,A3B6TOEXSQVO24,"S. brown ""shiney lady""",0,1,5,1292457600,spicy thai chips,"TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.  signed up for the subscribe and save option.  the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS.  the price per unit equals $1.73  per package.  that is not even the cost of plain chips.  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal.  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS.  p.s.  even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve.  ENJOY"
515,B000G6RYNE,A16S0NQ3MWJXFL,ObsidianGT,0,1,5,1291248000,"Delicious, what else did you expect?","Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!<br /><br />The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Delicious!"
516,B000G6RYNE,A1UM73T71CFPSY,Rich,0,1,5,1291075200,Great Value,"Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. I'd definitely recommend."
517,B000G6RYNE,A38KP1POQ191WT,"Judy Schinske ""Veronica""",0,1,1,1279065600,"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips""","These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
518,B000G6RYNE,A1AVLKAXW55QQA,M. Simpson,0,1,4,1264982400,Spicy but good,"If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be."
519,B000G6RYNE,A2DQBXU2LEVWWA,V. Lowe,0,1,3,1261699200,boulder salt and malt vinegar chips are way better,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome."
520,B000G6RYNE,A4NDPXCYKRCY2,Janet R. Miles,0,1,2,1258588800,POTATO CHIPS,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
