I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.

843,B000UWSQT0,A1LWILWU3AAFPG,"Christine Giles ""shazzypupp""",0,0,3,1262304000,not creamy...,"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste."
844,B000UWSQT0,A1A0JJPS4JAZHI,JJ,0,0,5,1233619200,This caramel is fantastic!!!,"Having eaten (and re-eaten) my way though all of the DAS caramel range, this remains my all-time favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them (which isn't an easy thing to do - just try one and you'll see what I mean).  I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement)."
845,B000UWSQT0,AHYRTWABDAG1H,"E. Thomsen ""arvig""",0,0,5,1226275200,Great caramels,"Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt."
846,B000UWSQT0,AL7ASCO6NWTJ6,Aristides P. Caringal,0,0,5,1217808000,Where Has This Candy Been?,This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had.  I just wish it came in bigger pieces.  I finished the whole box in one sitting!  I will certainly buy them again.
847,B000UWSQT0,A1LO4ME566EKLC,Show Me,0,1,1,1227916800,not for traditional caramel lovers,"Not my idea of a good caramel.  Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. I missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels."

849,B0041CKRJC,A2EIIDTYMJAEXV,"Tattletails ""Bonny""",1,1,5,1346198400,Aluminum Free!,"This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so it's great for changing your pH level in your body!"
850,B0041CKRJC,A13G8CNY7VX57F,Poppie,1,1,5,1322870400,This baking soda is the 'bomb!',"I recently started using Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda.  I'm very pleased with it's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum.  Thanks, Bob!"
851,B0041CKRJC,A3OFVFM2H4XQPT,naturechef,1,2,3,1347321600,Interesting info about baking soda,"If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bob's Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this brand is perfect.<br /><br />Just thought you'd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)<br /><br />P.S- So as not to let all of amazon.com-land feel I am one of those ""haters who don't really know what they're talking about"", I LOVE Bob's Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products."
852,B0007NG568,A2YPBLSWGVCGVL,"Thom Reece ""Marketing Consultant""",4,4,5,1278720000,"Excellent quality product, fast delivery...","The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)"
853,B0007NG568,AEFA52M4MT4H6,rr707,2,2,5,1311465600,"Good oatmeal, I'm on my second bag","I'm happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. However, I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price.<br /><br />Edit: I'm on my 4th bag, quality continues to be high."

855,B0007NG568,A2BF7B1EJBMNSY,Vanessa Malone,0,0,5,1319673600,Loved the Oats!!,"Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.<br /><br />Otherwise it's an excellent buy."

Arnold,5,5,4,1220745600,awsome,"I looooove pocky, got once at lucky's and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.<br /><br />Great product, and great price from this merchant!"
858,B000VKYKTG,A1PZN8AP463DG,spoiler09,2,2,5,1295827200,Very Happy with Pocky Sticks,"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated."
859,B000VKYKTG,A1VMGTCTZUKHV6,Bulldog,2,2,5,1294790400,These are great!,"Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy."
860,B000VKYKTG,A3CFKMOCU5C5UR,M. Thompson,2,2,5,1292112000,I love this snack!,"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)"
