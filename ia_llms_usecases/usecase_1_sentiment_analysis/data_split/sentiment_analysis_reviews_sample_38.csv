Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency..."
742,B001HTKZ5S,AOHGLP2W3B3I4,Scott Schrantz,0,0,1,1281312000,"Do Not Buy This ""Frosting""","I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."

I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!
744,B001BB3LW6,A1ZS6CRXGZX4YE,R. Martin,1,1,4,1308182400,Lots of pops!,Well worth the money. I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value. There are approx 2338 pops in the box. So far I've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. That's pretty good considering. If you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. Enjoy.
745,B005Y0DXBO,A21TGZU9EXJ272,mizztanya,2,2,5,1336435200,"when you have no fridge but want meat, what do you do?","This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I don't eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild ""spam""-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason."

With all that's in it, this is a very good value. Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it. My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia. Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink, albeit at a lesser level.<br /><br />BTW: Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping."
747,B001LO4ZWI,A2M687HYOW9JFW,dream factory,2,2,1,1334448000,Perversion of taste,"A watered down perversion of the acai berry.<br /><br />This juice comes on strong and harsh.  With tart aftertaste and no texture.<br /><br />That's because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.<br /><br />You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice."

This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.<br /><br />This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.

To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.<br /><br />The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor."

752,B0035YE9CS,A3K0UVMET7SEWE,Electric Leaf,10,12,4,1283644800,"Good soy sauce, but not special. Mainly good as unique gift.","This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate."

Now he puts it on many things. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much.  In the past, I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce (where virtually all of it is made).  What a treat to find a handmade American product, that competes with (and wins), against a Japanese/Chinese national staple!"

I had three soy sauces to choose from.  After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass!  Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness.  We were splashing right on every piece, rather that dunking/dipping. Friends wanted to know where I found it. I'm going back to order more right now, and I'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that's affordable and unique; instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it's boring."
