784,B0018DQFPC,AEC3FERY6U28I,BigCityLady,1,1,4,1293408000,Spongetastic!,My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...

786,B0018DQFPC,A18OUU4I29BU9F,"Jennifer L. Eidsvold ""ShaylaRed""",2,3,1,1262649600,Not one but twice came broken.,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."

If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date!

It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.<br /><br />Well, one tea bag was enough for me.  My mother-in-law said, ""Oh, that smells kind of like wine.""  Okay, kind of like wine, with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste.  If she likes it, she can have the whole box."

I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product."

795,B00285FF6O,A2S244KFX0745K,Alan Edward Creager,3,3,5,1285718400,There is none greater.,"The best chocolate in the world, in this critic's humble opinion, is made in the United States. And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you."

The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli."
