The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips."
442,B000G6RYNE,A35JPD8Q492FJC,Firefly,0,0,5,1304640000,Yowzah!!,"For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors."
443,B000G6RYNE,A391CLP4UMXJQG,Dane King,0,0,4,1300924800,Very good.,Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
444,B000G6RYNE,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,"John B. Goode ""JBG""",0,0,5,1300579200,Excellent!,"What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."

446,B000G6RYNE,A19G8B2QYETD7W,NyahNyah,0,0,3,1297555200,Heavy on the Vinegar,"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste."
447,B000G6RYNE,A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,Jason Ralsky,0,0,4,1295913600,"A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor","I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!"
448,B000G6RYNE,ACFPHOYVB71V4,karob,0,0,5,1292630400,BEST BUY in BBQ Chips,Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
449,B000G6RYNE,A1H80WDFOR94Q5,Injured Panda,0,0,5,1290556800,Love Them!,"Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.<br /><br />Crunchy, real potato chips!"
450,B000G6RYNE,A3Q5YZNYGGUP8W,cppme,0,0,5,1290297600,Crunchy and Tasty,"These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips."
451,B000G6RYNE,AKRLMISQPL8QW,B. Sanders,0,0,5,1289174400,Convenience at low cost,"I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!"
452,B000G6RYNE,A2MUGFV2TDQ47K,"Lynrie ""Oh HELL no""",0,0,3,1288915200,An Acquired Taste,"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)"

Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
456,B000G6RYNE,A2H2Q5RW1K56AI,a Thai living in MN,0,0,5,1263945600,Excellent Thai-flavored chip,"I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting."

460,B000G6RYNE,A3492ZW10B65ON,"P. Young ""Sugahplumm""",0,0,5,1250640000,OooH Yummy!,"I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little ""portion control"". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!"
