I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!"
722,B000G6MBX2,A3J6N95DIJTPVH,"B. P. Mayeux ""bpmayeux""",0,1,5,1203811200,Excellent Tortilla chips,"These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!"
723,B000G6MBX2,A3MALNCOVF5COP,Overseas Mom,0,1,5,1203206400,Black Beans Never Tasted So Good!!!,"These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)"

726,B000G6MBX2,ARLTWKV2AUJ2F,koboilila,1,4,2,1237939200,Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE,"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
727,B001F33UPI,AGXEFR3PWFEM,Steph,0,0,5,1345939200,Great candy,"Wonderful candy, hard to find.  I got a huge bag and put it in freezer.  It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. Just great!"

These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun. My friends and I think it is a good idea to  order them again for our Mid-Autumn Festival party."
730,B008BEGP9W,A1MJ0MF2OFIU4D,Chris,0,0,4,1340496000,A Surprising Find,"I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.<br /><br />I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time."

Regardless of the quantity error though, it sure kicked some red.<br /><br />Everyone in my town absolutely loves it. I highly recommend along with other soda, Voltages.<br /><br />-Malcom"

First of all let me tell you the price is amazing, I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia. Everyone in village loved it, of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it."

Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzel's I had when<br />i purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction."
734,B004A8QK98,A2QWGB918P1HU0,Runriverrun,1,1,5,1325894400,Delicious!,This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  It's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn't terribly bad for your diet.  It's delicious!
735,B004A8QK98,A2FZE965O64BXJ,Grandma LU,0,1,1,1342742400,Disappointed!,"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: ""supreme"" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the ""supreme"" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully."
736,B001HTKZ5S,ARQ2DJUU4XB1V,Cooking  Mama,2,2,1,1263686400,Perhaps something was wrong with the batch...,"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time."

I'm so mad at myself for wasting my money, and not trying to make it from scratch at home. Which would probably end up better and cheaper. Oh well, live and learn!"
738,B001HTKZ5S,A3KJ6JZ8MWERPG,RnnrGrl,1,1,1,1264896000,Big Disappointment,"I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!"
739,B001HTKZ5S,A1USXH72S0TD4B,Michelle M. White,0,0,1,1287100800,Worst Frosting Ever,"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this."

It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible"
