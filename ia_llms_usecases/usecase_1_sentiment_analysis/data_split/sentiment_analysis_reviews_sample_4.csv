63,B001EO5TPM,A1E09XGZUR78C6,gary sturrock,2,2,1,1215302400,stale product.,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,RLC,3,3,5,1333497600,Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!,"I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough."
65,B005DUM9UQ,A2XIHNXODNZGV4,"ChemProf ""chem professor""",1,1,5,1333584000,great source of electrolytes,This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.
66,B005DUM9UQ,A3TWF9DQ6MU87E,dhy4b,1,1,5,1331510400,Great for preventing cramps,This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,Doug,0,0,5,1345161600,Low Carb Alternative to Gatorade,"For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The ""zero carb"" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work....."
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,Bill Shirer,0,1,2,1338422400,Taste is not so good.,"I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take."
69,B000E7VI7S,A1KL2LAW08X6UQ,calmnsense,0,0,3,1169251200,How much would you pay for a bag of chocolate pretzels?,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping)."
70,B000E7VI7S,AWCBF2ZWIN57F,C. Salcido,0,2,5,1185753600,pretzel haven!,this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,Chet,2,2,5,1254355200,Great Gummi!,"These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!"
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,2tall,1,1,5,1289260800,Bigger then other brands,"Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!"
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,Marie,0,0,5,1327017600,Best ever latice tart,"I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed."
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,Diana Robinson,0,1,1,1335744000,Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
75,B001EPPI84,A3Q0IDQ03S0158,Jen,0,0,2,1287705600,nothing special,It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again
76,B001EPPI84,A27TZ4WBU7N0YF,I. So,0,0,1,1275004800,No Tea Flavor,No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,Jessica Snyder,0,0,5,1348444800,Good,"These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up."
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,"Debs ""peanut""",0,0,5,1348185600,Taste great,These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!
79,B004X2KR36,A2AB7M9UCNBVN7,sharonh4,0,0,3,1346976000,Order only in cold weather,"The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor."
80,B005R8JE8O,A3H1EQD2PBC085,jmc,0,0,5,1344902400,this is the best,"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp."
