326,B003VTN95K,A6Y49ZNS6NPN0,Ute H. Bischoff,0,0,5,1345334400,coffee-mate coffee creamer hazelnut,i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.
327,B003VTN95K,A3G467T8H2U4F1,Breanna,0,0,5,1342137600,No broken creamers!,"These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!"
328,B003VTN95K,AKG4UJNVSHHAD,flowergirl,0,0,4,1340582400,Shipped great,"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D"
329,B003VTN95K,A1J7ZSFU0SO3D4,ck,0,0,5,1336003200,Better Packaging,"Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable."

The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them."

My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright ""thinking of you this spring"" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!"

I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend."

I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee."

340,B000HKYP9A,A2CHZ5Q2EF3IR3,Mommy with an Opinion,2,2,5,1168905600,"Love, Love, Love These!","Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
