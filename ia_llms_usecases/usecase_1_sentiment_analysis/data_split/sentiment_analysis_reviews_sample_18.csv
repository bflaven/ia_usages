341,B000HKYP9A,AD5WAUA14YD6N,M. Knapp,0,0,4,1281657600,"great for eating whole foods, clean with veggie brush","I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture."

343,B000HKYP9A,A6VEEE9HOL004,"Jaime M ""Luc's Mom""",0,0,3,1180224000,Only good for ice,This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.
344,B000HKYP9A,A3JBI5QDS32UEM,J. Foreman,0,0,5,1173484800,Great for teething,"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!"
345,B000HKYP9A,AMNCDXFZKL6MZ,C. Lamberts,0,0,3,1173484800,Wonderful idea-difficult to clean.,"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags."

Nayeem ""Hanaa's mommy""",0,0,3,1171584000,I wasn't that impressed,"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts."

Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per..."
348,B00067AD4U,A2OB1BFAEPAYBM,R. C. Wilkins,1,1,5,1207440000,Great Beans!!!,I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!
349,B00067AD4U,A3GT3KCGY9EYF4,Siri J,1,1,5,1198195200,Good stuff!,"""These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose.

Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with ""demand"""

353,B000SEJ84M,A19Y7MSOR2J7XP,G. Macleod,0,0,5,1258588800,The product is great but the price is out of line,"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices."
354,B001LMNXFA,ATBV3QRAVD2PJ,"Michelle L. West ""Paisleymll""",3,3,5,1280361600,Swedish Pearl is not the same as  Belgian Pearl,"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls."

357,B000U9V5AU,A2VOVLKP603R1T,D. J. Brown,7,7,5,1297468800,Taste-tested by a wine maker,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."

I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again."

I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far."

The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!"
