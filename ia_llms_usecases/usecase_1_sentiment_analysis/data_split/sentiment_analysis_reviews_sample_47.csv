921,B000ER6YO0,A1ERHEVGUWLRBB,Aviva Chil,0,0,1,1341360000,FOUND SHREDDED PLASTIC IN THE BABY FOOD!!!!,"I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing."

923,B000ER6YO0,A3SFS8R1T6JJM9,PolyOWannaCracker,0,0,3,1318032000,Meh.  My daughter eats most everything else... this isn't her thing.,"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite."
924,B000ER6YO0,AWBKE3QTB3BWX,Nessie,0,0,3,1315958400,Not as yummy as Earth's Best's other flavors,"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein."
925,B000ER6YO0,ACM3Z9NLSE8S9,Tracy,0,0,5,1314835200,Son's 2nd Favorite Dish,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
926,B000ER6YO0,AKSSGVF9DMJDU,"Gretchen Rowley ""Gretchen Rowley""",0,0,1,1299542400,Had to toss 9 out of 12 jars,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
927,B000ER6YO0,A2F0WNTW3QQZYS,Ruth,0,0,5,1298505600,One of our favorites,"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up."
928,B000ER6YO0,A2NQKBC54RAZL5,Keribeth,0,0,4,1297296000,Our Baby Likes it,"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom."
929,B000ER6YO0,A2NQKBC54RAZL5,Keribeth,0,0,5,1297296000,Our Baby's Favorite Dinner,The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.
930,B000ER6YO0,A11LJJL1SOH6W0,"Sarah Ross ""Mamasaurus Rex""",0,0,4,1296259200,My daughter's favorite jarred food,"My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!"
931,B000ER6YO0,A2UY1O1FBGKIE6,"U. Kane ""UBK""",0,0,5,1293840000,yum,I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her
932,B000ER6YO0,A11UPZ6LI1UJZY,Pono,0,0,5,1293580800,the only jarred baby food my son ate,"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too."
933,B000ER6YO0,A88OW6BJKW3Q3,"Amazon PrimeTime ""Brandi""",0,0,3,1291248000,A little more watery than other 2nd foods for EB,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help."
934,B000ER6YO0,A3NXCL9NJTL3TF,Target Shopaholic,0,0,5,1286496000,50 calories of yumminess,"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time."

936,B000ER6YO0,A13EBBWOMC0FUI,"Sherean Malekzadeh ""Sherean""",0,0,5,1263168000,One of my son's favorites,"My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors."

938,B000ER6YO0,A34AHOC0OXMR2K,"T. Hunter ""T. Hunter""",0,0,5,1257897600,They make the best baby food.,My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.

He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.
