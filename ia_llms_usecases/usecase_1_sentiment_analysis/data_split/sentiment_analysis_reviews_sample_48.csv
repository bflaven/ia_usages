942,B000ER6YO0,A2KTFTRTY0ONWF,CarlaVeg,1,2,2,1294531200,Baby didn't like it,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
943,B000ER6YO0,A62UHEAJJE7E,A. Peckinpaugh,1,2,5,1240704000,My baby's favorite dinner,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin."
944,B000ER6YO0,A2U138G3VKRZSL,"Art ""NYC guy""",0,1,1,1312675200,"Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it","This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."

946,B000ER6YO0,ATIHDHZYNQ0EI,"Kristen O'donnell ""twinsmom""",0,1,5,1270425600,Organic and Tasty,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
947,B000ER6YO0,A16XMNOX8N0DOQ,Momjules,1,3,4,1319760000,My baby liked it,I didn't eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.
948,B000ER6YO0,A20DF2DTZYI8TQ,H Harkins,0,2,1,1302048000,moms (and dads) beware of plastic in the food,I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.

954,B000S806VM,A3QYHVYQLU8MJC,Patti Henson,4,4,5,1276128000,Sassafras Tea Bags,As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
955,B000S806VM,A2HF72GRWTRW35,"James H. Walder ""Jim Walder""",3,3,4,1299196800,sassafrass tea,"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or ""bark"" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract."
956,B000S806VM,AIR7BNZFT751N,Paul K. Williams,2,2,4,1251849600,Good tasten tea.,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.

958,B000S806VM,A3MMB5RKFP57N1,J. Kelly,1,1,5,1306195200,Better Taste Than I Expected,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!
959,B000S806VM,AL4M4T6T3JHY3,candiceemoe,2,3,5,1327881600,lovely!,"bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn't had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he'd shut up."
960,B000S806VM,A3FIUP4KF49FOH,K,0,0,1,1347926400,K,"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again."
