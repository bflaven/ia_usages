After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"

When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh"

My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, we've just received our second case. It won't last long. Beware."
713,B000G6MBX2,AC82F5LXJCR22,kimberly,0,0,5,1199577600,Perfect tortilla chip goodness!,"My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!"

They are not available where I live, so I ordered them from Amazon.  WOW!  My friends and family are all addicted to them.  The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite.  Once a bag is open, it is gone!"
715,B000G6MBX2,A14B8M117EUBLK,Shelly Kenyon,0,0,5,1180656000,Best tortilla chips ever!!!,We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
716,B000G6MBX2,A228P3VH7SFBHG,J,1,2,2,1219449600,Meh,"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."
717,B000G6MBX2,A1AQ2W2R4SOVGN,De Profundis,6,10,1,1195084800,"The ""Organic"" Label is Misleading","""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."
718,B000G6MBX2,A3NCTCNAUYCH6H,jesse girl,0,1,3,1278374400,Kind of Bland,"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again."
719,B000G6MBX2,ADD87VB66Y0DQ,"L. Pray ""bargainqueen""",0,1,5,1277337600,Delicious chips,"Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast."
720,B000G6MBX2,A2GS0QUCV2KVMP,Stephanie J. Myers,0,1,4,1209686400,Broken chips but tasty,I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.
