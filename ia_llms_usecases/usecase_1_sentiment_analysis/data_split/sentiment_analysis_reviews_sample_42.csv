821,B003AO5DLO,A3BEO6VFOO8FRB,AggieSpaniel,2,2,5,1307664000,Great deal!,"Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!"
822,B003AO5DLO,A30QZ7UKDUJHBB,"Olga Kochar ""Olga Kochar""",2,2,5,1304380800,Great food!,This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product!
823,B003AO5DLO,A20HTVL7JE0JG2,Reginald H. Arthur,1,1,5,1342656000,Buster Loves this dog food,"I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.<br /><br />I only buy this brand food for him now.<br /><br />Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars."
824,B003AO5DLO,A36D2ED3Q81YEQ,Atheenas,1,1,4,1332806400,Happy Dogs,"I bought this for my one year old Cocker. However all the dogs love it. All their coats look better, they all shed less, eat less, use the bathroom less, my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems. It seems to have cleared up, no more smell. Her eyes give her less problems. And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less, he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy. Our black lab mix, hot spots and she would just lick her fur off. All these great changes in a matter of a month.  I do mix it roughly 50/50 with Naturals dog food blend.  They are doing great.<br /><br />Sept 2012<br />I love this breed specific food, however I just went to place my next bi-monthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month!  I paid<br />$41.79 on Aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now $53.94, a difference of $12.15 in price!  This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge; due to the speculation over crops :( I will look to my local vet for this product. I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer. They will order a larger bag if you ask."

We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)"
827,B003AO5DLO,A3IQFDK2A3APGE,SH,0,0,5,1350086400,Happy Dog,My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it's good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Hard to find elsewhere.
828,B0007NG56I,A1HHS1SELWW6NY,Clancey,16,17,5,1242000000,Great way to order,"My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I'm running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I've found in the grocery store."
829,B0007NG56I,AMQ8L5JWWDGIA,anon63,12,13,5,1269129600,"Good quality, delivered on time, human edible.","Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies)."
830,B0007NG56I,AN808YPCW2C2F,Chef Victoria,4,5,5,1333065600,Rave Review for Rolled Oats,Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.<br />The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.
831,B001EQ55BI,A3JMLZS0QJCD5N,Mary Swinn,0,0,5,1323216000,Excellent,"Nice flavor, not too bitter.  We really like this coffee.  We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family's tastes and this is the one."
832,B000IXUISS,A212N0TUR007EK,Anshuman Arun,11,11,1,1274745600,Very Different taste from the 'Made in UK' or 'Made in India' version.,The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
833,B000IXUISS,A19YEVVAPRW51R,Craig Cook,7,7,1,1285545600,Not like other countries Cadbury,"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA."
834,B001ELL9X6,A298O68DGTCC48,Anthro Mom,9,9,5,1198022400,Great deal on great tea,"My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."
835,B001ELL9X6,A2EOU0LXAOMPG,"Edith Faile ""sewcrabby""",1,1,5,1271289600,Best Breakfast Tea ever,This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.

Excellent. The resealable bags work well, and unopened they protect my large stash, making it easier to manage my subscription."
837,B001ELL9X6,A397CWU6DM3O5G,ganka,0,0,3,1348617600,"Mediocre, but cheap","The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway."
838,B001ELL9X6,A2IRN7AVMV5PPL,Louis,0,0,5,1346284800,Delicious and consistently good quality,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha."
839,B001ELL9X6,A2SSX0VOP3CHZW,"D. Umeno ""discerning consumer""",0,0,4,1305417600,Nice flavorful tea for the purist black tea addict,"I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child - it was always my mother's favorite - so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a ""large volume"" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore."
840,B001ELL9X6,ALNSBHX0BCMBJ,afficionado,0,0,5,1300406400,the best tea,"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds."
