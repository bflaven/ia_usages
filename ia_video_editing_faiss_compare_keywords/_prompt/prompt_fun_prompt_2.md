Can you summarize the text below and list the main ideas in a bullet points list with a small definition of each idea. This list should be attractive editorially for a blog post ?

Society has never been more egalitarian—in theory. Prejudice is taboo, and diversity is strongly valued. At the same time, social and economic inequality have exploded. In We Have Never Been Woke, Musa al-Gharbi argues that these trends are closely related, each tied to the rise of a new elite—the symbolic capitalists. In education, media, nonprofits, and beyond, members of this elite work primarily with words, ideas, images, and data, and are very likely to identify as allies of antiracist, feminist, LGBTQ, and other progressive causes. Their dominant ideology is “wokeness” and, while their commitment to equality is sincere, they actively benefit from and perpetuate the inequalities they decry. Indeed, their egalitarian credentials help them gain more power and status, often at the expense of the marginalized and disadvantaged.

We Have Never Been Woke details how the language of social justice is increasingly used to justify this elite—and to portray the losers in the knowledge economy as deserving their lot because they think or say the “wrong” things about race, gender, and sexuality. Al-Gharbi’s point is not to accuse symbolic capitalists of hypocrisy or cynicism. Rather, he examines how their genuine beliefs prevent them from recognizing how they contribute to social problems—or how their actions regularly provoke backlash against the social justice causes they champion.

A powerful critique, We Have Never Been Woke reveals that only by challenging this elite’s self-serving narratives can we hope to address social and economic inequality effectively.

In the fall of 2015, student protesters seemed suddenly to be everywhere. From the University of Missouri to Yale, they called on universities to deploy their educational programs and resources to fight racial injustice. Videos of their protests had observers opining that something was either very wrong or very right with the kids. Attention turned to Generation Z, whose first cohort had recently matriculated: Perhaps their coddled childhoods made them fragile; perhaps their diversity made them wise.


We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite


In “We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite,” Musa al-Gharbi tells us that our focus on Generation Z is a distraction. Nothing new was arriving on campus; by 2015, we were years into the Fourth Great Awokening.

Mr. al-Gharbi, a sociologist and assistant professor at Stony Brook University, uses “Great Awokening” to refer to dramatic, rapid shifts in the attitudes and activities of knowledge workers—or, as he calls them, “symbolic capitalists.” These are the people who produce and interpret data, images and words and work in fields like education, media, law and finance.

The most recent awokening, Mr. al-Gharbi tells us, began not in 2015 but around 2011. After 2011, the use of “terms referring to various forms of prejudice and discrimination” surged in popular media outlets. Related shifts in focus occurred in academic research, advertising and entertainment. Meanwhile, affluent, well-educated white liberals—symbolic capitalists are mostly that—began to adopt attitudes we now call woke. For example, they came to perceive “much more racism against minorities than most minorities . . . reported experiencing.” Increasingly, they joined the Democratic Party and became “more militant.”

Here's an editorial-style summary of the main ideas from the text about "We Have Never Been Woke":

# The Paradox of Modern Equality: Key Insights from "We Have Never Been Woke"

**The Rise of Symbolic Capitalists**
* A new elite class of professionals who work primarily with words, ideas, images, and data
* Found in sectors like education, media, law, and finance
* Predominantly composed of well-educated, affluent white liberals who champion progressive causes

**The Fourth Great Awokening**
* A dramatic shift in attitudes and activities among knowledge workers starting around 2011
* Marked by a surge in discussions about prejudice and discrimination in media
* Characterized by symbolic capitalists perceiving more racism than minorities themselves report experiencing

**The Equality Paradox**
* Modern society claims to be more egalitarian than ever, with diversity celebrated and prejudice condemned
* Yet social and economic inequality continues to grow exponentially
* These seemingly contradictory trends are actually interconnected

**The Power Dynamic**
* Symbolic capitalists gain status and influence through their advocacy for equality
* Their egalitarian credentials paradoxically help them maintain and expand their privileged position
* They often inadvertently contribute to the inequalities they publicly oppose

**The Language of Justification**
* Social justice terminology is increasingly used to legitimize the elite's position
* Those who fall behind in the knowledge economy are often dismissed for having the "wrong" views on social issues
* This creates a self-reinforcing system where progressive language serves as a tool for maintaining status

**The Unintended Consequences**
* Well-meaning advocacy can provoke backlash against the very causes being championed
* The elite's genuine beliefs often blind them to their role in perpetuating social problems
* Real progress on inequality requires challenging these self-serving narratives

This analysis reveals how modern progressive activism, despite its sincere intentions, can sometimes reinforce the very power structures it aims to dismantle.
