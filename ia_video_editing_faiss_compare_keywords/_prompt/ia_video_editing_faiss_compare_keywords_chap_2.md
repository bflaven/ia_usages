The Big Dive part 2 : The 2025 US presidential election through the lens of "We Have Never Been Woke," a book critiquing a new "woke" elite. 



## Input
This excerpt analyzes the 2025 US presidential election through the lens of "We Have Never Been Woke," a book critiquing a new "woke" elite. The author explores how the Democratic party's embrace of identity politics, termed "diversity entrepreneurship," has alienated tech and created an ineffective political message, contrasted with the Republican party's simpler, unifying appeal. The core argument revolves around how symbolic capitalists, a new elite wielding influence through language and social justice narratives, unintentionally maintain power structures while advocating for equality, creating a paradox of modern equality. The analysis uses the election as a case study to highlight the broader implications of this dynamic in the context of AI's impact and the disintegration of both major political parties.

## Paranoia Chapter or "Everyone is out to get me"

A small note on this last chapter: After all, writing remains an outlet, it is both a serious and relaxing exercise. Even if the following chapter is incomprehensible, which may be detrimental to me, it does not entirely reflect my opinion either. I am clumsily trying to reflect at the beginning of this year and especially to evacuate cliches, redundancies and other hackneyed phrases that harm my thinking. First, I try to deflate as much as poverty and emptiness in my wording and nourishes my philosophical self-education!

Let's say that the American presidential elections is always a unique opportunity to measure the state of the world. Personally, it was after Trump's first election that I stopped writing in French, considering that the world was global with no way back. Check out: [D3 – Représentation avec D3 d'un réseau avec le gouvernement Trump comme exemple](https://flaven.fr/2017/01/d3-representation-avec-d3-dun-reseau-avec-le-gouvernement-trump-comme-exemple/)

8 years later, the changes are even more advanced and the disintegration of both Democrats and Republicans is even more advanced. It's not easy to approach such a subject without coming across as either a conspiracy theorist, a hater or a a supporter from one side or another.

**What is ultimately the political offer of the two camps present? An how IA is a game changer....**

## On the Democrat side

Let's first examine the Democratic camp. Social networks and tech in general were long-term supoorter of the Democratic Party, with the exception of Peter Thiel. This is no longer the case. No one in the US wants to be in the camp of losers. In the eyes of tech, from hype, Democrats have become old-fashioned.

The observation is cruel, the defeat is bitter. It is indeed that of an American elite, which is often described as "out of touch". So, beyond AI, why such a turnaround in tech? There are many books that analyze the "left" or "democratic" elites, but there is one in particular that acutely illuminates the ideological contradictions of this same elite.

This is "We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite" by Musa al-Gharbi.

A remarkable book that shows the issues that the Democratic camp has been confronted with. In this, these American elections of 2025 show what could happen in Europe, in a country like France or Germany.

**"We Have Never Been Woke"...What this is all about?**

He is interested in "Social Narratives" in the sense of how a constituted social group, we could also speak of a social class, perceives itself and tells its story to the rest of society. His observation is clear.

> Medias, Democrats believe fundamentally that they are altruistic and that they serve the common good, and it is not true anymore.

After the **self-entrepreneur**, doped up by performance, who is rather on the Republican side. Welcome to the **diversity entrepreneur** who, to establish his privileges, his power and his prestige, hypocritically uses social justice and the fight for minorities.

These "symbolic capitalists", as Musa al-Gharbi calls them, use Wokism as a banner to better dominate. It is a belief brandished by educated classes who swear by inclusiveness and egalitarianism in speeches, but do not realize in practice that they are increasingly cut off from the rest of the population.

How a new "woke" elite uses the language of social justice to gain more power and status—without helping the marginalized and disadvantaged

In a more Franco-French debate, we are not far from what Christophe Guilluy denounced in "French Fractures".

Even more relevant or worrying is that in the ideological market of democrats, how do we distinguish ourselves, how do we make our proposal as a diversity entrepreneur more attractive, by aggregating the struggles and fights on his person. Thus, the competition within the cultural elites has been based on victimization.

So, according to him, this is the ultimate in the intersectionality of struggles, by essentializing you as non-gendered, racialized, a follower of degrowth... the list is endless! This produces a syncretism that allows you to exist in a niche from which you dominate… It is the ultimate achievement of the Marxist question "where are you speaking to me from?"

Certainly, it strongly smells of post-modernist analysis of politics. Analysis that assimilates politics to only storytelling but it is undoubtedly enlightening
However this seduction having atomized Kamala's democratic political offer is no longer successful and especially does not unite to create a homogeneous group, hence the bitter failure in the elections unlike Trump's ideology which is entirely in Canetti's "mass and power".

## The Paradox of Modern Equality: Key Insights from "We Have Never Been Woke"

**The Rise of Symbolic Capitalists**
- A new elite class of professionals who work primarily with words, ideas, images, and data
- Found in sectors like education, media, law, and finance
- Predominantly composed of well-educated, affluent white liberals who champion progressive causes

**The Fourth Great Awokening**
- A dramatic shift in attitudes and activities among knowledge workers starting around 2011
- Marked by a surge in discussions about prejudice and discrimination in media
- Characterized by symbolic capitalists perceiving more racism than minorities themselves report experiencing

**The Equality Paradox**
- Modern society claims to be more egalitarian than ever, with diversity celebrated and prejudice condemned
- Yet social and economic inequality continues to grow exponentially
- These seemingly contradictory trends are actually interconnected

**The Power Dynamic**
- Symbolic capitalists gain status and influence through their advocacy for equality
- Their egalitarian credentials paradoxically help them maintain and expand their privileged position
- They often inadvertently contribute to the inequalities they publicly oppose

**The Language of Justification**
- Social justice terminology is increasingly used to legitimize the elite's position
- Those who fall behind in the knowledge economy are often dismissed for having the "wrong" views on social issues
- This creates a self-reinforcing system where progressive language serves as a tool for maintaining status

**The Unintended Consequences**
- Well-meaning advocacy can provoke backlash against the very causes being championed
- The elite's genuine beliefs often blind them to their role in perpetuating social problems
- Real progress on inequality requires challenging these self-serving narratives

This analysis reveals how modern progressive activism, despite its sincere intentions, can sometimes reinforce the very power structures it aims to dismantle.

It is also true that denouncing this in this way does not also play into the hands of the opposing party, in this case the Republicans and their leader Trump and his "broligarchy".

For "broligarchy" concept, see the post "La temible broligarquía [https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-21/la-temible-broligarquia.html](https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-21/la-temible-broligarquia.html)

## On the Republican side
On the transformation induced by AI, informational obesity is everywhere. Not a day goes by without one of the digital moguls (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos...) or even some expert, harping on about the benefits of AI. But the world has not seemed so much in crisis. There is something in this fear to do with the cognitive bubble in which I am immersed.
