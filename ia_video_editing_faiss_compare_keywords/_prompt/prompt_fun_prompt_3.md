<h2>On the Democrat side</h2>

Let's first examine the Democratic camp. Social networks and tech in general were long-term supoorter of the Democratic Party, with the exception of Peter Thiel. This is no longer the case. No one in the US wants to be in the camp of losers. In the eyes of tech, from hype, Democrats have become old-fashioned.


The observation is cruel, the defeat is bitter. It is indeed that of an American elite, which is often described as "out of touch". So, beyond AI, why such a turnaround in tech? There are many books that analyze the "left" or "democratic" elites, but there is one in particular that acutely illuminates the ideological contradictions of this same elite.

This is "We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite" by Musa al-Gharbi.

A remarkable book that shows the issues that the Democratic camp has been confronted with. In this, these American elections of 2025 show what could happen in Europe, in a country like France or Germany.

<b>"We Have Never Been Woke"...What this is all about?</b>

He is interested in "Social Narratives" in the sense of how a constituted social group, we could also speak of a social class, perceives itself and tells its story to the rest of society. His observation is clear.

<blockquote>Medias, Democrats believe fundamentally that they are altruistic and that they serve the common good, and it is not true anymore.</blockquote>

After the <b>self-entrepreneur</b>, doped up by performance, who is rather on the Republican side. Welcome to the <b>diversity entrepreneur</b> who, to establish his privileges, his power and his prestige, hypocritically uses social justice and the fight for minorities.
 

These "symbolic capitalists", as Musa al-Gharbi calls them, use Wokism as a banner to better dominate. It is a belief brandished by educated classes who swear by inclusiveness and egalitarianism in speeches, but do not realize in practice that they are increasingly cut off from the rest of the population.


How a new "woke" elite uses the language of social justice to gain more power and status—without helping the marginalized and disadvantaged

In a more Franco-French debate, we are not far from what Christophe Guilluy denounced in "French Fractures".

Even more relevant or worrying is that in the ideological market of democrats, how do we distinguish ourselves, how do we make our proposal as a diversity entrepreneur more attractive, by aggregating the struggles and fights on his person. Thus, the competition within the cultural elites has been based on victimization.

So, according to him, this is the ultimate in the intersectionality of struggles, by essentializing you as non-gendered, racialized, a follower of degrowth... the list is endless! This produces a syncretism that allows you to exist in a niche from which you dominate… It is the ultimate achievement of the Marxist question “where are you speaking to me from?”

Certainly, it strongly smells of post-modernist analysis of politics. Analysis that assimilates politics to only storytelling but it is undoubtedly enlightening
However this seduction having atomized Kamala's democratic political offer is no longer successful and especially does not unite to create a homogeneous group, hence the bitter failure in the elections unlike Trump's ideology which is entirely in Canetti's "mass and power".

    <h1>The Democratic Tech Elite: A Crisis of Narrative and Identity</h1>

    <h2>Key Insights into the Transformation of Democratic Political Discourse</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Tech Disillusionment</strong>
            <p>The once-loyal tech community is rapidly distancing itself from the Democratic Party, perceiving the party as outdated and disconnected from contemporary dynamics. What was once a symbiotic relationship has transformed into a critical disconnect.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Symbolic Capitalism</strong>
            <p>A new breed of "diversity entrepreneurs" leverage social justice language not to genuinely empower marginalized groups, but to establish personal privilege, power, and social status. This performative activism masks underlying power structures.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Victimization as Currency</strong>
            <p>Within cultural elites, differentiation and social positioning have become increasingly dependent on constructing intricate narratives of victimhood. The more complex one's intersectional identity, the more cultural capital is accumulated.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Narrative Fragmentation</strong>
            <p>The Democratic political strategy has devolved into a collection of niche, atomized narratives that fail to create a cohesive, unifying message. This approach contrasts sharply with more monolithic political movements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Ideological Disconnect</strong>
            <p>Despite claiming to serve the common good, the Democratic elite has become increasingly detached from broader societal experiences, creating a widening gap between rhetoric and lived reality.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Reference</h3>
    <p>This analysis draws heavily from Musa al-Gharbi's groundbreaking book "We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite".</p>
