<h2>Paranoia Chapter or "Everyone is out to get me"</h2>

A small note on this last chapter: After all, writing remains an outlet, it is both a serious and relaxing exercise. Even if the following chapter is incomprehensible, which may be detrimental to me, it does not entirely reflect my opinion either. I am clumsily trying to reflect at the beginning of this year and especially to evacuate cliches, redundancies and other hackneyed phrases that harm my thinking. First, I try to deflate as much as poverty and emptiness in my wording and nourishes my philosophical self-education!

Let's say that the American presidential elections is always a unique opportunity to measure the state of the world. Personally, it was after Trump's first election that I stopped writing in French, considering that the world was global with no way back. Check out : <a href="https://flaven.fr/2017/01/d3-representation-avec-d3-dun-reseau-avec-le-gouvernement-trump-comme-exemple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3 – Représentation avec D3 d’un réseau avec le gouvernement Trump comme exemple</a>

8 years later, the changes are even more advanced and the disintegration of both Democrats and Republicans is even more advanced. It's not easy to approach such a subject without coming across as either a conspiracy theorist, a hater or a a supporter from one side or another.


<b>What is ultimately the political offer of the two camps present? An how IA is a game changer....</b>


<h2>On the Democrat side</h2>

Let's first examine the Democratic camp. Social networks and tech in general were long-term supoorter of the Democratic Party, with the exception of Peter Thiel. This is no longer the case. No one in the US wants to be in the camp of losers. In the eyes of tech, from hype, Democrats have become old-fashioned.


The observation is cruel, the defeat is bitter. It is indeed that of an American elite, which is often described as "out of touch". So, beyond AI, why such a turnaround in tech? There are many books that analyze the "left" or "democratic" elites, but there is one in particular that acutely illuminates the ideological contradictions of this same elite.

This is "We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite" by Musa al-Gharbi.

A remarkable book that shows the issues that the Democratic camp has been confronted with. In this, these American elections of 2025 show what could happen in Europe, in a country like France or Germany.

</ul>


<b>"We Have Never Been Woke"...What this is all about?</b>

He is interested in "Social Narratives" in the sense of how a constituted social group, we could also speak of a social class, perceives itself and tells its story to the rest of society. His observation is clear.

<blockquote>Medias, Democrats believe fundamentally that they are altruistic and that they serve the common good, and it is not true anymore.</blockquote>

After the <b>self-entrepreneur</b>, doped up by performance, who is rather on the Republican side. Welcome to the <b>diversity entrepreneur</b> who, to establish his privileges, his power and his prestige, hypocritically uses social justice and the fight for minorities.
 

These "symbolic capitalists", as Musa al-Gharbi calls them, use Wokism as a banner to better dominate. It is a belief brandished by educated classes who swear by inclusiveness and egalitarianism in speeches, but do not realize in practice that they are increasingly cut off from the rest of the population.


How a new "woke" elite uses the language of social justice to gain more power and status—without helping the marginalized and disadvantaged

In a more Franco-French debate, we are not far from what Christophe Guilluy denounced in "French Fractures".

Even more relevant or worrying is that in the ideological market of democrats, how do we distinguish ourselves, how do we make our proposal as a diversity entrepreneur more attractive, by aggregating the struggles and fights on his person. Thus, the competition within the cultural elites has been based on victimization.

So, according to him, this is the ultimate in the intersectionality of struggles, by essentializing you as non-gendered, racialized, a follower of degrowth... the list is endless! This produces a syncretism that allows you to exist in a niche from which you dominate… It is the ultimate achievement of the Marxist question “where are you speaking to me from?”

Certainly, it strongly smells of post-modernist analysis of politics. Analysis that assimilates politics to only storytelling but it is undoubtedly enlightening
However this seduction having atomized Kamala's democratic political offer is no longer successful and especially does not unite to create a homogeneous group, hence the bitter failure in the elections unlike Trump's ideology which is entirely in Canetti's "mass and power".

<h2>The Paradox of Modern Equality: Key Insights from "We Have Never Been Woke"</h2>

<b>The Rise of Symbolic Capitalists</b>
<ul>
<li>A new elite class of professionals who work primarily with words, ideas, images, and data</li>
<li>Found in sectors like education, media, law, and finance</li>
<li>Predominantly composed of well-educated, affluent white liberals who champion progressive causes</li>
</ul>


<b>The Fourth Great Awokening</b>
<ul>
<li>A dramatic shift in attitudes and activities among knowledge workers starting around 2011</li>
<li>Marked by a surge in discussions about prejudice and discrimination in media</li>
<li>Characterized by symbolic capitalists perceiving more racism than minorities themselves report experiencing</li>
</ul>

<b>The Equality Paradox</b>
<ul>
<li>Modern society claims to be more egalitarian than ever, with diversity celebrated and prejudice condemned</li>
<li>Yet social and economic inequality continues to grow exponentially</li>
<li>These seemingly contradictory trends are actually interconnected</li>
</ul>

<b>The Power Dynamic</b>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic capitalists gain status and influence through their advocacy for equality</li>
<li>Their egalitarian credentials paradoxically help them maintain and expand their privileged position</li>
<li>They often inadvertently contribute to the inequalities they publicly oppose</li>
</ul>

<b>The Language of Justification</b>
<ul>
<li>Social justice terminology is increasingly used to legitimize the elite's position</li>
<li>Those who fall behind in the knowledge economy are often dismissed for having the "wrong" views on social issues</li>
<li>This creates a self-reinforcing system where progressive language serves as a tool for maintaining status</li>
</ul>

<b>The Unintended Consequences</b>
<ul>
<li>Well-meaning advocacy can provoke backlash against the very causes being championed</li>
<li>The elite's genuine beliefs often blind them to their role in perpetuating social problems</li>
<li>Real progress on inequality requires challenging these self-serving narratives</li>
</ul>

This analysis reveals how modern progressive activism, despite its sincere intentions, can sometimes reinforce the very power structures it aims to dismantle.

It is also true that denouncing this in this way does not also play into the hands of the opposing party, in this case the Republicans and their leader Trump and his "broligarchy".

For "broligarchy" concept, see the post "La temible broligarquía <a href="https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-21/la-temible-broligarquia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-21/la-temible-broligarquia.html</a>

<h2>On the Republican side</h2>
On the transformation induced by AI, informational obesity is everywhere. Not a day goes by without one of the digital moguls (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos...) or even some expert, harping on about the benefits of AI. But the world has not seemed so much in crisis. There is something in this fear to do with the cognitive bubble in which I am immersed.

It is a fact that it is difficult to deny the growing importance of AI in changing our perception of the world and ourselves.

Basically, our human activities, our own thinking seem to oscillate between a leveling of humanity up or down. In short, either AI will make us smarter or stupider. In any case, the AI's phenomenon relentlessly spreads an ideology made of performance, instantaneity... Using AI means distilling a vision of the world at all costs and in fact obeying the rules of storytelling, the story of entrepreneurs of themselves always eager for efficiency, return on investment, economic rationality too,... in short, the silicon vallay Californian doxa made of this technophile syncretism, transhumanism and neo-liberalism.

So what happens to duration, attention, concentration? These are now disappearing commodities. They are and will be even more precious than the sacrosanct data itself.

It is said that data is the fuel, which is true for now. In the same way, our "fusion" with the machine is approaching, the AI's agent waiting for the robot is the glaring manifestation of it. Soon, like a hamster in its wheel or a rabbit hypnotized in the headlights of a car, we will no longer have the capacity to decide. For comfort and ease, we will probably have capitulated our free will.

Indeed, the permanent emotional injunction tires us, weakens us emotionally. If we react only emotionally to events, seduced by the slightest charlatan, we therefore become inexorably subjugated, all our, while having the leisure to feel without acting for all that.

In order to freak out totally, the destruction of the rational individual, who will only be commanded by his reptilian will destroy is the first stone of that of society as well as the political system (democracy), the very notion of nation state. With AI we are therefore heading straight towards the dictatorship of a small number over a docile mass of individuals.

I think that this is broadly the Thiel program and this is probably what we must partly understand about Musk's rise. The future is ugly when we are paranoid.

Even more than social networks, AI is an overpowering vector of conformism that completely transforms us into exclusively social beings, that is to say totally subservient to the norm.



<b>Model sovereignty, the key to information independence</b>
The lack of sovereignty over the models can raise the question of informational independence and also offers the owners of the models (LLM) opportunities for manipulation of opinion as well as propaganda.

AI is therefore a powerful lever of manipulation to shape opinions. How to prepare an opinion for an annexation, a war, an invasion, a deportation. I also asked Grok and ChatGPT the question...


<pre>
- Can Canada become a province of the United States?
- Does the annexion of Groendland by the United States is doable?
</pre>


Forging one's own narrative is the essence of propaganda. That's all there is to technology and especially AI.

The main ingredient of storytelling is tension, often distilled by the injunction to novelty, conflict or finally sexuality.

Without becoming scabrous, it's not easy to introduce sex into an article on AI. Oh yes, perhaps if it's about the symbolic power of sex either as an allegory of power or as a subject of transgression.

We'll see what Trump and his government will do after the inauguration. It's a safe bet that to make an impression and assert his authority, he won't hesitate to behave like a tyrant, granting amnesty to his supporters, hunting down his opponents while preserving his interests and the political future of his successors.

Trump's campaign speech has reached decree zero of speech, it is reduced to a musical playlist and words hammered out like magical beliefs.


Trump has therefore conquered power thanks to his ideals, revaluing force, unilateralism. Trump like all these bros are transactional beings, they close deals with the double-entry approach in mind: on one side the gains and on the other the losses.

He is not an ideologue. In a sense, he recycles the strange paradox of the USA since the post-war period, namely the imperialist temptation and isolationism specific to a self-sufficient continent state indifferent to the fate of the rest of the world, with certainly a touch of racism, religiosity and paranoia, therefore a lot of obtuse conservatism.

His ideology is variable geometry, not sure that this is the case for the people around him who are more ideologues. We will see in the test of time and the exercise of violence if the displayed cohesion does not give way. This reminds me of this quote from A. Hitler, ideals are shared, will this government or not cross shared criminality without giving up?


<blockquote>There are two things that can unite men: common ideals and shared criminality. A. Hitler</blockquote>
