## PROMPT_1

As a python expert, rewrite all the script so I can cut and paste.
- to fix the error below

```text
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
We strongly recommend passing in an `attention_mask` since your input_ids may be padded. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/troubleshooting#incorrect-output-when-padding-tokens-arent-masked.
You may ignore this warning if your `pad_token_id` (50256) is identical to the `bos_token_id` (50256), `eos_token_id` (50256), or the `sep_token_id` (None), and your input is not padded.
```
- improve the code and do not hesitate to comment each line, to leverage on best practices, using class and function.



# PERPLEXITY_1
Here's an improved version of the script that addresses the error and incorporates best practices, including the use of classes and functions with comments:

```python

This improved version of the script addresses the attention mask warning and incorporates several best practices:

1. We've organized the code into classes (`FaceRecognizer` and `ImageCaptioner`) to improve modularity and readability.

2. Each method now has a docstring explaining its purpose.

3. To fix the attention mask warning, we've set the pad token to be the same as the eos token in the `ImageCaptioner` class initialization.

4. We've added error handling for face encoding in the `load_known_faces` method.

5. The image captioning model now uses beam search with early stopping for potentially better captions.

6. The main function is now more concise and easier to read.

To use this script:

1. Install the required libraries: `face_recognition`, `pillow`, `numpy`, `torch`, and `transformers`.
2. Place your input images in a directory named "pictures".
3. Place images of known faces in a directory named "known_faces". The filenames (without extensions) will be used as the names for recognition.
4. Set the `use_directory` boolean to `True` if you want to use all images in the "pictures" directory, or `False` to use the specified `image_paths`.
5. Run the script.

This version should resolve the attention mask warning and provide a more robust and maintainable codebase[1][2][3][4][5][6][7].
