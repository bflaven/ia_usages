## PROMPT_1
As python and a MAC expert can you detail the install of CLIP with the help of conda, give step by step all the required commands.

## PERPLEXITY_1

To install CLIP using Conda on a Mac, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.

2. If you haven't already, install Anaconda or Miniconda. If needed, download the installer for your Mac architecture (Intel or M1) and run it[1].

3. Create a new Conda environment for CLIP:

```bash
conda create -n clip_env python=3.8
```

4. Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate clip_env
```

5. Install PyTorch, which is a prerequisite for CLIP:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

6. Install CLIP using pip (as it's not available directly through Conda):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

7. Install additional dependencies that CLIP might require:

```bash
conda install ftfy regex tqdm
```

8. Verify the installation by running a Python interpreter and importing CLIP:

```bash
python -c "import clip; print(clip.__version__)"
```

If no errors occur and a version number is printed, CLIP has been successfully installed.

Remember to activate the `clip_env` environment whenever you want to use CLIP in your projects[2][6].
