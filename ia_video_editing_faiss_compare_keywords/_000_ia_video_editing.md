## PROMPT_1
Translate in to english and improve the logic of the text below :

Derrière ce code, la user story est simple : Faire un rapprochement sémantique entre tous les mots-clés existant dans un CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Homemade CMS) et une une liste de mots-clés générée par de l'Intelligence Artificielle via un prompt (Claude, Mistral, Chatgpt) afin de proposer une liste de mots-clés existants restreinte sur la base de la proposition IA.

The code leverage on this model  SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')





## CHATGPT_1

Here is the improved and translated version of your text with better logic:

---

The underlying user story for this code is straightforward: to establish a semantic match between all existing keywords in a CMS (such as WordPress, Drupal, or a custom-built CMS) and a list of AI-generated keywords using prompts (e.g., with Claude, Mistral, or ChatGPT). The goal is to generate a refined list of existing keywords based on the AI's suggestions.

The code utilizes the **SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')** model to achieve this semantic matching effectively.

This version clarifies the intent and aligns the logic more cleanly for an English-speaking audience while retaining technical accuracy. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!


## PROMPT_2
Make a very simplistic explanation of the definition below and connect it to the two use cases below

- Faiss definition
Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta's Fundamental AI Research group.

- use case Faiss #1 for text
Faiss will then be used to fasten the task of ordering text with the help of the model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" and provide the best title among a set of titles.

- use case Faiss #2 for image
Faiss is combined with CLIP  then can be used to fasten the task of ordering images and enable natural language research for a user in multilingual context with the help of the model "CLIP" and provide the best image among a set of images.

CLIP: Connecting text and images
https://openai.com/index/clip/

The CLIP library is used through "open_clip"
https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip

- use case #3 for image
Additional use case that has nothing to do with Faiss. It is just an attempt to generate the best image description so it can be use for image search or generating alt message. It leverage on "face_recognition" and "transformers"




## CHATGPT_2
### Simplistic Explanation of Faiss:  
Faiss is a tool that helps find similarities between things like text or images, even when the dataset is huge. It works very fast, even for large files that don’t fit in your computer's memory. It uses smart algorithms to compare and group items efficiently and can work with Python or on the GPU for speed.

---

### Use Case Connections:

#### **Use Case #1: Text Ordering**
Faiss is used with the **"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"** model to quickly rank and organize text titles. It helps pick the best title from a list by understanding how similar each one is to the ideal choice.

#### **Use Case #2: Image Ordering**
Faiss works with **CLIP** (a tool that connects text and images) to sort images based on their relevance to a user’s multilingual text input. For example, if a user searches "beautiful sunset," it finds the most suitable image from a collection, even if the text is in different languages.

---

### Unrelated Use Case: Image Descriptions
A separate method using **face_recognition** and **transformers** creates accurate descriptions for images. These descriptions can improve image search or provide useful alternative text (alt messages) for accessibility. For instance, it might describe an image as "A smiling person at the beach during sunset," which is helpful for users and search engines.

## PROMPT_3
Make a very simplistic explanation and a user story from the script description: make a streamlit app that with a with a whisper json export with the help of spacy, it indicated "Detected Entities", "Key Phrases", "Text Segments" and show the timecode that could be the cue point IN and the cue point OUT for each element where the script found these elements inside the transcription 

## CHATGPT_3
### Simplistic Explanation:  
This app helps analyze text from a transcription file (exported as JSON from Whisper). It uses a tool called SpaCy to find important information like "Detected Entities" (e.g., names, places), "Key Phrases" (important topics), and "Text Segments" (specific parts of the text). For each of these, it shows the time when they start (cue point IN) and end (cue point OUT) in the audio or video.

---

### User Story:
**As a** content creator or video editor,  
**I want** an app that analyzes transcriptions from my audio or video files,  
**So that** I can easily find key moments (like when important topics or entities are mentioned) and use the timecodes to edit or navigate my content efficiently.
