## PROMPT_1
As Python expert, can you:

- 1. First, write different sequences with the objective to assist video editing in order to allow video automatic cutting based on the video audio transcription. For each sequence, provide a possible model or package to perform this operation.
- 2. Second, then based on the sequencing, write scripts with python for each sequence that has been defined.


## PERPLEXITY_1

1. Sequences for automatic video cutting based on audio transcription:

## Sequence 1: Transcription and Silence Detection

1. Transcribe the video audio using a speech recognition model
2. Detect silent segments in the audio
3. Generate timestamps for speech and silence

**Possible models/packages:** 
- Speech recognition: OpenAI Whisper or Google Speech Recognition
- Silence detection: PyDub or Librosa

## Sequence 2: Content-based Segmentation

1. Analyze the transcription for semantic breaks or topic changes
2. Identify key phrases or important segments
3. Generate cut points based on content analysis

**Possible models/packages:**
- Natural Language Processing: spaCy or NLTK
- Text segmentation: TextTiling algorithm

## Sequence 3: Editing and Export

1. Use the generated cut points to trim the video
2. Apply transitions between segments (optional)
3. Export the final edited video

**Possible models/packages:**
- Video editing: MoviePy
- Export: FFmpeg (via Python bindings)

2. Python scripts for each sequence:

## Sequence 1: Transcription and Silence Detection

```python
import whisper
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.silence import detect_silence

def transcribe_and_detect_silence(video_path):
    # Load Whisper model
    model = whisper.load_model("base")

    # Transcribe video
    result = model.transcribe(video_path)
    transcription = result["text"]

    # Extract audio from video
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(video_path, format="mp4")

    # Detect silent segments
    silence_thresh = -40  # Adjust as needed
    min_silence_len = 1000  # 1 second
    silent_ranges = detect_silence(audio, min_silence_len=min_silence_len, silence_thresh=silence_thresh)

    return transcription, silent_ranges

# Usage
video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
transcription, silent_ranges = transcribe_and_detect_silence(video_path)
```

## Sequence 2: Content-based Segmentation

```python
import spacy
from texttiling import TextTiling

def segment_content(transcription):
    # Load spaCy model
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

    # Process transcription
    doc = nlp(transcription)

    # Perform TextTiling
    tt = TextTiling(w=20, k=10)
    segments = tt.run(doc)

    # Extract key phrases (simplified example)
    key_phrases = [chunk.text for chunk in doc.noun_chunks if chunk.root.pos_ in ['NOUN', 'PROPN']]

    return segments, key_phrases

# Usage
segments, key_phrases = segment_content(transcription)
```

## Sequence 3: Editing and Export

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips

def edit_video(video_path, cut_points):
    # Load video
    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)

    # Create subclips based on cut points
    subclips = []
    for start, end in cut_points:
        subclip = video.subclip(start, end)
        subclips.append(subclip)

    # Concatenate subclips
    final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(subclips)

    # Export final video
    output_path = "edited_video.mp4"
    final_clip.write_videofile(output_path)

    return output_path

# Usage
cut_points = [(0, 10), (15, 30), (40, 50)]  # Example cut points in seconds
edited_video_path = edit_video(video_path, cut_points)
```

These scripts provide a basic framework for automatic video editing based on audio transcription. You'll need to install the required packages (whisper, pydub, spacy, texttiling, moviepy) and may need to adjust parameters for optimal results[1][2][3][4].

## PROMPT_2
Can you rewrite the scripts as the objective is to set cut_points based on the transcription analysis e.g let say the topic of the video id "war in Ukraine", then I want to have a serial of cut_points that found the name entity "Ukraine".

## PERPLEXITY_2
Certainly! I'll rewrite the scripts to set cut_points based on transcription analysis, focusing on finding the named entity "Ukraine" in a video about the war in Ukraine. Here's an updated version of the scripts:

## Sequence 1: Transcription and Named Entity Recognition

```python
import whisper
import spacy

def transcribe_and_find_entities(video_path, target_entity="Ukraine"):
    # Load Whisper model
    model = whisper.load_model("base")

    # Transcribe video
    result = model.transcribe(video_path)
    transcription = result["text"]

    # Load spaCy model for named entity recognition
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

    # Process transcription
    doc = nlp(transcription)

    # Find timestamps for the target entity
    cut_points = []
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.text.lower() == target_entity.lower():
            # Assuming Whisper provides word-level timestamps
            start_time = result["segments"][ent.start].start
            end_time = result["segments"][ent.end - 1].end
            cut_points.append((start_time, end_time))

    return transcription, cut_points

# Usage
video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
transcription, cut_points = transcribe_and_find_entities(video_path, "Ukraine")
```

## Sequence 2: Content-based Segmentation (Optional)

```python
from texttiling import TextTiling

def segment_content(transcription, cut_points):
    # Load spaCy model
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

    # Process transcription
    doc = nlp(transcription)

    # Perform TextTiling
    tt = TextTiling(w=20, k=10)
    segments = tt.run(doc)

    # Refine cut points based on segment boundaries
    refined_cut_points = []
    for start, end in cut_points:
        segment_start = max(s.start for s in segments if s.start <= start)
        segment_end = min(s.end for s in segments if s.end >= end)
        refined_cut_points.append((segment_start, segment_end))

    return refined_cut_points

# Usage (optional)
refined_cut_points = segment_content(transcription, cut_points)
```

## Sequence 3: Editing and Export

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips

def edit_video(video_path, cut_points):
    # Load video
    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)

    # Create subclips based on cut points
    subclips = []
    for start, end in cut_points:
        subclip = video.subclip(start, end)
        subclips.append(subclip)

    # Concatenate subclips
    final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(subclips)

    # Export final video
    output_path = "edited_video_ukraine.mp4"
    final_clip.write_videofile(output_path)

    return output_path

# Usage
edited_video_path = edit_video(video_path, cut_points)
```

These updated scripts focus on finding instances of the named entity "Ukraine" in the video transcription and using those instances to create cut points. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. In the first sequence, we use Whisper for transcription and spaCy for named entity recognition. The script finds all occurrences of "Ukraine" and creates cut points based on their timestamps.

2. The second sequence is optional and uses TextTiling to refine the cut points based on content segmentation. This can help ensure that the cuts occur at more natural boundaries in the content.

3. The third sequence remains largely the same, using MoviePy to edit the video based on the identified cut points.

To use these scripts, you'll need to install the required packages (whisper, spacy, texttiling, moviepy) and download the appropriate spaCy model. You may need to adjust the target entity or add multiple entities depending on your specific requirements[1][2][4].
