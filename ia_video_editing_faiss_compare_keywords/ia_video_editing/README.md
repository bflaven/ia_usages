# ia_video_editing: Attempt using streamlit and spacy to make video editing
 
### Explanation:
This app helps analyze text from a transcription file (exported as JSON from Whisper). It uses a tool called SpaCy to find important information like "Detected Entities" (e.g., names, places), "Key Phrases" (important topics), and "Text Segments" (specific parts of the text). For each of these, it shows the time when they start (cue point IN) and end (cue point OUT) in the audio or video.

### User Story:
**As a** content creator or video editor,  
**I want** an app that analyzes transcriptions from my audio or video files,  
**So that** I can easily find key moments (like when important topics or entities are mentioned) and use the timecodes to edit or navigate my content efficiently.
