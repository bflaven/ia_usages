1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Some already saw him as head of Germany's Social Democratic Party instead of Olaf Scholz.

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,020
But Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has quelled days of uncertainty about his Chancellor candidacy

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,560
pulling out of the parliamentary election race.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,579
I have just informed our party and parliamentary group leaders that I will not be standing as

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,159
a candidate for the office of Chancellor.

6
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:26,739
This is my sovereign and personal decision.

7
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:32,720
He endorsed his competitor Olaf Scholz, who earlier this month saw the collapse of his three-way

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,240
coalition over differences about how to revive the economy.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,000
I have repeatedly emphasised this in recent weeks, and I am making it very clear today.

10
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,439
In Olaf Scholz, we have an outstanding Chancellor.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,900
For the SPD, the announcement comes as a wake-up call, as members within Olaf Scholz's own party

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,240
have raised doubts about his candidacy, with some politicians calling on Scholz to make way

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,259
for Pistorius, fearing that the already unpopular Chancellor would further put the party at a disadvantage.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,220
National surveys show the SPD polling around 15 percent, well behind the Conservatives at 33

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,220
percent and behind the far right at 19 percent.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,019
Olaf Scholz's entourage remains confident that the Chancellor could win, despite recent polls showing otherwise.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,639
Only 21 percent of Germans see Olaf Scholz as a good candidate, compared to 60 percent who back Boris Pistorius.

18
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,919
The incumbent Chancellor's plummeting ratings have done little to stop Scholz, as the SPD leader

19
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:43,800
will run for a second term and is due to be officially nominated as a candidate on 11 January 2025.
