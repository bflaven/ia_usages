1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,059
President Putin has put the missile speculation to rest.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,600
Russia's attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro was carried out using what he called

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:18,379
a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, fired in response to Kiev's recent strikes using weaponry from Western allies.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,420
Under combat conditions, a test of one of Russia's newest medium-range missile systems was also

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,299
carried out, in this case with a non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile.

6
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:32,740
Our missile engineers named it Oreshnik. The tests were successful.

7
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:37,939
One of the largest and most famous industrial complexes since Soviet times that still produces

8
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,939
weapons was destroyed in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,380
While unconfirmed reports from Ukraine suggested Russia had used an ICBM, an intercontinental

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,439
ballistic missile designed for long-distance nuclear strikes.

11
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:59,959
According to Putin, Oreshnik, Russian for hazelnut tree, is capable of Mach 10, going ten times the speed of sound.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,959
And he warned that US and European air defence systems would be powerless to stop it.

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,639
Should more Oreshnik strikes be launched, he said Russia would issue advanced warnings to Ukrainian citizens, allowing for evacuations.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,599
He also gave an ominous direct threat to the West, saying that the experimental missile could

15
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,080
also be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to strike Russia.

16
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,760
The Pentagon confirmed that Moscow had launched an experimental intermediate-range ballistic

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,900
missile and that the US had had some forewarning.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,360
In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre-notified briefly before

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,199
the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels.

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,819
This was a new type of lethal capability that was employed on the battlefield, so that's certainly of concern to us.

21
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,199
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of using Ukraine as a testing ground and

22
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,040
appealed to world leaders to react.
