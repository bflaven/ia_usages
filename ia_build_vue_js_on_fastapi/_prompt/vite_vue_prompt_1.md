## OUPUT
Certainly! Vite.js is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and more streamlined development experience for web projects. Here are the steps to create a Vite.js application with Vue.js:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Create a new Vite.js project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Vite.js project:

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app my-vue-project --template vue
```

This command creates a new directory named `my-vue-project` and initializes a Vite.js project using the Vue.js template.

### Step 3: Navigate to the project directory

Navigate to the project directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd my-vue-project
```

### Step 4: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 5: Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite.js development server and serves your Vue.js application. By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 6: Build for production

When you are ready to build your Vue.js application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a production-ready build of your Vue.js application in the `dist` directory.

### Step 7: Serve the production build (Optional)

You can serve the production build locally to preview it by running the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This command serves the production build of your Vue.js application, allowing you to preview it locally before deploying it to a web server.

That's it! You have successfully created a Vue.js application using Vite.js. You can now start building your application by editing the files in the project directory.
