## PROMPT
```bash
# prompt_3
Create an file "App.vue" for the javascript Vue project where the user can post a name in a field named "name_search". The form send a request to an API on a endpoint named "/generate_name" and the API send back a json like the one below
{
"name": "Bernard"
}

Load the value for the name inside the "App.vue".

## OUPUT
Certainly! Below are the commands and steps to manipulate a Vite.js application using axios to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against an API:

### Step 1: Install axios

First, you need to install axios, which is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Run the following command in your Vite.js project directory:

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Step 2: Import axios in your Vue.js components

Once axios is installed, you can import it into your Vue.js components where you want to make API calls. For example, in your Vue component file (`MyComponent.vue`), you can import axios like this:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
```

### Step 3: Make CRUD operations using axios

Now, you can use axios to perform CRUD operations against your API endpoints. Here's how you can use axios to perform each operation:

#### Create (POST) operation:

```javascript
axios.post('your-api-endpoint', data)
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Data created:', response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error creating data:', error);
    });
```

#### Read (GET) operation:

```javascript
axios.get('your-api-endpoint')
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Data fetched:', response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
```

#### Update (PUT/PATCH) operation:

```javascript
axios.put('your-api-endpoint', dataToUpdate)
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Data updated:', response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error updating data:', error);
    });
```

#### Delete (DELETE) operation:

```javascript
axios.delete('your-api-endpoint')
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Data deleted:', response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error deleting data:', error);
    });
```

### Step 4: Interact with your API

Replace `'your-api-endpoint'` with the actual URL of your API endpoint, and `data` or `dataToUpdate` with the data you want to send in the request body for Create and Update operations.

With these steps, you can manipulate your Vite.js application using axios to make CRUD operations against your API. Make sure to handle responses and errors appropriately in your application logic.
