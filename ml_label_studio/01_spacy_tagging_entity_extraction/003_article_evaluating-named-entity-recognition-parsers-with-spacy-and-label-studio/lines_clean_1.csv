Prologue,1,Joe Franklin?,Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:00.17
Prologue,1,I'm ready.,Joe Franklin,subject,00:00:00.58
Prologue,1,It's Ira Glass here.,Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:01.39
Prologue,1,"Oh, you're the emcee on the show, Ira.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:00:02.84
Prologue,1,I am the emcee on the show. Yes.,Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:04.45
Prologue,1,"Oh great. Ira? I-R-A, Ira?",Joe Franklin,subject,00:00:05.89
Prologue,1,"Ira, I-R-A.",Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:07.56
Prologue,1,"Oh, great. Now hold on one second, Ira. Don't go away. Hello? [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Call me after 3 o'clock. I have great news for you. Ira.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:00:08.32
Prologue,1,Yes.,Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:18.83
Prologue,1,"So listen, Tony. If the phone rings, take it in the back. And then come out and tell me who it is. Just say, Joe's being with a camera crew. Just for about 10 minutes. We'll do about five minutes, 10 minutes, right, Ira?",Joe Franklin,subject,00:00:19.29
Prologue,1,That's right.,Ira Glass,interviewer,00:00:33.14
Prologue,1,"Well, one great thing about starting a new show is utter anonymity. Nobody really knows what to expect from you. This interviewee did not know us from Adam.",Ira Glass,host,00:00:39.96
Prologue,1,"OK, we're what? About a minute. We're one minute five into the new show. Right now, it is stretching in front of us, a perfect future yet to be fulfilled. An uncharted little world. A little baby coming into the world, no little scars on it or anything.",Ira Glass,host,00:00:54.89
Prologue,1,"Nobody hearing my words right now is thinking, ""Oh, man, remember that show, back when it used to be good? That show, I never missed that show back in the old days, back in the first couple years before it got so-called popular. Back when it was still good.""",Ira Glass,host,00:01:12.16
Prologue,1,"No, actually, I think that force, that human desire to say that is so strong, to say that ""I was there back when that show was good,"" that force is so strong, it is so basic to who we are as people that I know-- OK, what are we? We are two minutes into the program-- I know that somewhere out there, one or two of you are saying, ""Oh, sure. I used to listen to that show back in the first 30 seconds, back when it used to be really good. Remember back when they used to do all that crazy stuff? When they had that guy on the phone? Remember back then?""",Ira Glass,host,00:01:31.13
Prologue,1,"Well, from WBEZ, in the glorious city of Chicago, Illinois. The name of this show is Your Radio Playhouse. I'm your emcee. I'm your emcee, Ira Glass.",Ira Glass,host,00:02:12.75
Prologue,1,"OK, the idea of this show, this new little show, is stories, some by journalists and documentary producers, like myself, some just regular people telling their own little stories, some by artists, and writers, and performers of all different kinds. And the idea is we're going to bring you stuff you're not going to find anywhere else. And there is also going to be music.",Ira Glass,host,00:02:35.34
Prologue,1,"And tonight's show, we thought that we would have a theme. Tonight's show is going to be New Beginnings. And to kick things off, I called the man who's had, as best as anybody can tell, the longest running program in the history of television. His name is Joe Franklin, and his program ran for 43 years on local television in New York. And he claims that he invented the talk show format. And I called him to get some advice on how to create a long-running, healthy program.",Ira Glass,host,00:02:52.38
Prologue,1,"I've been called in many times to give a sort of a Dean, the elder statesman, even though I'm still a young kid. But I've been called in to give this kind of advice to new kids on the block. Conan O'Brien had me on his first show. And people like that. There's no guidance. It's a matter of paying attention.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:03:22.10
Prologue,1,"Your voice, I've heard so much about the sparkle, about the energy in your voice. The voice, on radio especially, is everything. And when the guest is sitting with you, you've got to look into his eyes. Many times, you get an author on there who's begrudgingly sitting there. He'd rather be home in his ivory tower.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:03:40.15
Prologue,1,"And above all, get the plug fast. Otherwise, he's worried you're not going to make the plug for the book. And I created a line, Ira, that's been picked up by George Burns. I always said, the main ingredient for longevity in the talk show field, where the mortality rate is so staggering, the main ingredient is sincerity. And once you learn to fake that, then you got it made. I made that up. And I just played it by ear. I was a natural born talker, I guess.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:03:59.07
Prologue,1,"So let me just summarize what I'm getting from you. You're saying you should just pay attention, look people in the eye, be sincere when I'm on the air, get in the plug early.",Ira Glass,interviewer,00:04:27.78
Prologue,1,"That's the key. And don't look in their nose or their belly button. Look right in the eye. Eye contact is everything. And as I say, it's a lot of fun.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:04:36.31
Prologue,1,"And I never called anybody in my life to come on to my show. And I'm sure that they'll be coming to you too. I heard about you, and I called you and wanted to wish you good look, Ira. Imagine the thrill of John F. Kennedy walking into my studio. Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan, five times. And Bing Crosby.",Joe Franklin,subject,00:04:45.48
