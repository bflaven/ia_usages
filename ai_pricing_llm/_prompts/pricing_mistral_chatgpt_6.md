As an advanced programmer in Python, fix this code below, so the value "corrected_user_input" has a real replacement among "user_input" where the value named "word" with spelling error is replaced by the value with no spelling error named "corrected_word" and then print out the all result in  the variable "corrected_user_input"

```python
# Split the 'response1' string by newline character
response = results['answer'].split("\n")

# Create a list comprehension to extract key-value pairs from each line
result = [(line.split(":")[0], line.split(":")[1]) for line in response if line.strip()]

# Replace the misspelled words with the corrected words
for word, corrected_word in result:
    corrected_user_input = user_input.replace(word, corrected_word)

```

To fix your code snippet, there are a couple of things that need to be addressed. In the original code, the `corrected_user_input` variable is getting overwritten on each iteration, rather than accumulating the changes. Additionally, you should ensure that the code handles cases where the word might not be in `user_input`. Here's a corrected version that applies all replacements to `user_input` and then prints the result:

```python
# Split the 'answer' string by newline character
response = results['answer'].split("\n")

# Create a list comprehension to extract key-value pairs from each line
result = [(line.split(":")[0], line.split(":")[1]) for line in response if ":" in line]

# Initialize 'corrected_user_input' with 'user_input'
corrected_user_input = user_input

# Replace the misspelled words with the corrected words
for word, corrected_word in result:
    corrected_user_input = corrected_user_input.replace(word, corrected_word)

# Print the corrected user input
print(corrected_user_input)
```

In this corrected version:

1. The `corrected_user_input` variable is initialized with `user_input` to start with the original text.
2. During the loop, each misspelled word (`word`) is replaced with its correct spelling (`corrected_word`), updating `corrected_user_input`.
3. The variable `corrected_user_input` retains the previous corrections, allowing all replacements to be applied.
4. A check ensures that the line has a key-value pair separated by `:` to avoid potential issues if there's a blank line or an incorrect format in the split result.
