// Write the Cypress code to test that the fields in the post content: title, body, tags has been properly filled by the user and then save the post content created as draft


/*
Sure, here's an example Cypress code to test that the fields in the post content have been properly filled by the user and save the post content as draft:

 */

describe('Create post page', () => {
  it('should fill post content and save as draft', () => {
    // Visit the create post page
    cy.visit('/create-post')

    // Fill in the post title, body and tags fields
    cy.get('#post-title').type('My post title')
    cy.get('#post-body').type('This is the body of my post.')
    cy.get('#post-tags').type('cypress, testing')

    // Check that the post title, body and tags have been filled
    cy.get('#post-title').should('have.value', 'My post title')
    cy.get('#post-body').should('have.value', 'This is the body of my post.')
    cy.get('#post-tags').should('have.value', 'cypress, testing')

    // Click the save as draft button
    cy.get('#save-as-draft-button').click()

    // Check that the draft was successfully saved
    cy.get('.success-message').should('be.visible').and('contain.text', 'Post saved as draft.')
  })
})


/*
In this example, we visit the create post page, fill in the post title, body and tags fields, and then use Cypress assertions to check that they have been filled correctly. We then click the "Save as draft" button and use another Cypress assertion to check that the draft was successfully saved. Note that the selectors used in this example (#post-title, #post-body, #post-tags, #save-as-draft-button, and .success-message) will need to be adjusted based on the specific HTML of your create post page.
