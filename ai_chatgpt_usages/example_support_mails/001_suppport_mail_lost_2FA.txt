Subject: Assistance with Lost 2FA Authentication

Dear [Name],

I am writing this email in response to your request for help regarding your lost 2FA authentication. I understand how important it is to have access to your account, and I would be happy to assist you in renewing your access.

To begin, we can use our security questions to verify your identity and help you reset your 2FA authentication. Please provide answers to the following questions:

What is your mother's maiden name?
In what city were you born?
What is the name of your first pet?
Once we have received your answers, we will verify your identity and reset your 2FA authentication. After that, you will be able to access your account as normal.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help and ensure that your account remains secure.

Thank you for choosing our services.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Support Team
