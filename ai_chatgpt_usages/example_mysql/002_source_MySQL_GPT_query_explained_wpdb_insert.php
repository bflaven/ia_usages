/*
--- This code uses the WordPress database object, $wpdb, to insert a new record into a table called foods. The new record contains two pieces of data: the name of a fruit, which is "apple", and a year, which is 2012. The array() function is used to create an array of values to be inserted into the table. The second array() function specifies the format of the data being inserted, with %s indicating a string and %d indicating a number.

--- The global keyword is used to make the $wpdb variable accessible within the function or scope it is being used in. This is necessary because $wpdb is defined outside of the function in the global scope.

--- In summary, this code inserts a new record into a WordPress database table called foods with the values "apple" and 2012 for the fruit name and year, respectively.

/*
--- This code creates a table with six columns: "id" (the primary key), "FirstName", "LastName", "email", "address", and "country". The "id" column is defined as an auto-incrementing integer, which means that it will automatically generate a new, unique value for each new row that is inserted into the table.
