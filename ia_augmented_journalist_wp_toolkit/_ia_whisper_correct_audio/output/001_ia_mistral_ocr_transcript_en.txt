Welcome for this new tutorial. My name is Bruno Slaven. I've written an article about augmented journalism practical implementation of semantic clustering, multilingual transcription and some WordPress automation because I wanted to apply the semantic clustering. So first of all we're going to go through a few details so you can read the article if you want and you can grab on my GitHub account all these elements. So I will try I would go first with Mistral OCR then I will go on TrainingWhisper which is not exactly TrainingWhisper it's much more about how to use how to use whisper on non not well documented language like to go away from French English and Spanish and take more rare language like for instance I would say this way African language and stuff like that so anyway let's start first first so I've got everything in command in all the you know the file that has given on github and then I will do it manually in front of you so I'm using for instance well this is maybe too much I'm short-sighted so that's the reason why so right now we're going to go through the first one so I have commented everything so you have a bunch of so I'm going to use this environment you see it has changed I'm gone from base to Mistral OCR I don't give you but you have the requirement everything that you need ok so this one for instance we're going to go this is source and he's going to grab this little PDF and show me for instance what is inside so you see this is fake PDF and it's just to show you the ability of Mistral OCR to grab content for a very simple simple but we will go with more complex PDF after and the fact that you need a Mistral APK so for instance I'm not going to open my AMP because you will see my APK but you need to have an APK fortunately this is this is a paid service but he has very good what I say it's very interesting what I it's not what I say but what they have done is like state of art understanding complex document natively multilingual and multimodal which one thing that is very interesting for me and also you can also self host organization dealing with highly sensitive and classify information which is part of the sovereignty which is very important in a way because if you're working on journalism of stuff that are really radioactive you need to be sure that it's not going to share the content so let's say you see whoops sorry I think I'm in the wrong yeah I am in the wrong directory by the way I should update maybe this one okay that was a correct one so let's do it and you see so he has given yes they can yes yes see one page and then he's outputting the text meaning that you can output the text text in whatever you want and let's say so that was you know i've given so i'm just presenting few files so the three the four and the five i've already opened it because it's quicker to do the tutorial but you can so also seize you with the thing that i've made so let's say the three the four sorry that's another use case so right now i'm just gonna see if i'm in the correct place yeah i'm still in the correct place so i'm just checking that the command that i've made are okay the comment sorry and then so this one is going to do is going to take for instance a bigger one so let's go to i think you have you can see a certain amount of of french and mostly french and then english so let's stay this one i have to i've grabbed this one it's snowflake edition about generative ai and lm and you would see you have i guess you have a certain amount of page which is almost 44 and then you have the text and then you have the text and then you have the text and then each of the one are going to be in the order of three and then you have the text and then you have a lot of stuff which is very very complicated sometimes where you have three pages of text and then you have to go to the four and the five and then you have the three pages and the four i guess and you have a lot of bunch of stuff like that anyway we gonna create so i'm gonna take youtube three i think i made some taste and it should go right away so you see you have youtube three youtube to youtube because i made some tests and this time it's going to grab everything from this pdf so it's take a little bit of time and it should go yeah that's right so he has made three let's see that three and you see you have a bunch of stuff which is almost the content it's correct as it is in English it's even better but you should try also in Spanish in French and whatsoever if you need to do so but for instance I want to and then you can retreat this information for instance I don't need this image I just want to get rid of them so I'm gonna go through this one and clean up you know making some operations which is I'm trying to find some structured content from PDF and then I'm doing some post-production or some post-treatment so for instance this one is gonna you're gonna grab everything that looked like an image and he's gonna clean up the stuff so I would say this is three and I would say three okay so that's he's gonna take the just the document we have created and he's gonna clean up everything inside so you can add some stuff some reg X or whatever so ever and clean up your things so he has made the job you see it's pretty quick and then you see if you compare you have this has disappeared because I was not needing a such a thing and it's more clean and so you can detect some pattern inside the text whatsoever and then I mean consolidate your content what's for for any purpose like if you want to do a rag if you want to do some exploration if you don't do whatever you want and it's a very interesting way of working with different combination of document you have a lot of documentation right here I just explored the basic the basic of Mr. Ossier but you have a lot of possibility it's pretty well documented except that you have to pay for it it's not so expensive but still you you if you have to treat thousands of document yet it will cost a lot so I will hand up this video so we're gonna go through the case to which is training whisper which is not exactly training I should I should change the text but at the at the beginning that was one of my ideas but I want to test more different languages that's exactly what I'm saying right here in my queue this is a multi language that is interest me and if you need I also have some stuff about code switching okay but let's see it in the second video if you like my work please subscribe to my channel and I will see you in the next video don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel for instance which is right here and you can grab the content and read the article if needed okay see you bye bye you
