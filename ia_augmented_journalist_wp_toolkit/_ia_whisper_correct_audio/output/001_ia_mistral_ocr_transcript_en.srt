00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
Welcome for this new tutorial. My name is Bruno Slaven. I've written an article

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,600
about augmented journalism practical implementation of semantic clustering,

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,720
multilingual transcription and some WordPress automation because I wanted to

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,560
apply the semantic clustering. So first of all we're going to go through a few

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
details so you can read the article if you want and you can grab on my GitHub

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,560
account all these elements. So I will try I would go first with Mistral OCR

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,180
then I will go on TrainingWhisper which is not exactly TrainingWhisper it's much

8
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:53,420
more about how to use how to use whisper on non not well documented language like

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,700
to go away from

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,460
French English and Spanish and take more rare language like for instance

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,320
I would say this way African language and stuff like that so anyway let's

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,740
start first first so I've got everything in command in all the you know the file

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,940
that has given on github and then I will do it manually in front of you so I'm

14
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,740
using for instance well this is maybe too much

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,060
I'm short-sighted so that's the reason why so right now we're going to go

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,100
through the first one so I have commented everything so you have a bunch

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,100
of so I'm going to use this environment you see it has changed I'm gone from

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,500
base to Mistral OCR I don't give you but you have the requirement everything that

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,300
you need

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,360
ok so this one for instance we're going to go this is source and he's going to

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,960
grab this little PDF and show me

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,780
for instance what is inside so you see this is fake PDF and it's just to show

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,020
you the ability of Mistral OCR to grab content for a very simple simple but

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,780
we will go with more complex PDF after and the fact that you need a Mistral

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,000
APK so for instance I'm not going to open my AMP because you will see my APK

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,180
but you need to have an APK fortunately this is this is a paid service but he

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,600
has very good

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,740
what I say

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,540
it's very interesting what I it's not what I say but what they have done is

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,360
like state of art understanding complex document natively multilingual and

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,940
multimodal which one thing that is very interesting for me and also you can

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,720
also self host organization dealing with highly sensitive and classify

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,400
information which is part of the sovereignty which is very important in a

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,300
way because if you're working on journalism of stuff that are really

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,740
radioactive you need to be sure that it's not going to share the content so

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:03,080
let's say you see whoops sorry I think I'm in the wrong yeah I am in the wrong

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:13,620
directory by the way I should update maybe this one okay that was a correct

38
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,320
one so let's do it and you see so he has given yes they can yes yes see one page

39
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,540
and then he's outputting the text meaning that you can output the text

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,420
text in whatever you want and let's say so that was you know i've given so i'm just presenting

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,140
few files so the three the four and the five i've already opened it because it's quicker to do the

42
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,540
tutorial but you can so also seize you with the thing that i've made so let's say the three the

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,580
four sorry that's another use case so right now i'm just gonna see if i'm in the correct place

44
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,980
yeah i'm still in the correct place so i'm just checking that the command that i've made are okay

45
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,540
the comment sorry and then so this one is going to do is going to take for instance a bigger one so

46
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:09,580
let's go to i think you have you can see a certain amount of of french and mostly french and then

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,500
english so let's stay this one i have to i've grabbed this one it's snowflake edition about

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,860
generative ai and lm and you would see you have i guess you have a certain amount of page which is

49
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,960
almost 44 and then you have the text and then you have the text and then you have the text and then

50
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,940
each of the one are going to be in the order of three and then you have the text and then you have

51
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,760
a lot of stuff which is very very complicated sometimes where you have three pages of text

52
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,760
and then you have to go to the four and the five and then you have the three pages and the four i guess and you have a lot of bunch of stuff like that anyway we gonna create so i'm

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,120
gonna take youtube three i think i made some taste and it should go right away so you see you have

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,120
youtube three youtube to youtube because i made some tests and this time it's going to grab everything

55
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:53,360
from this pdf so it's take a little bit of time and it should go yeah that's right so he has made

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,760
three

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,840
let's see that three and you see you have a bunch of stuff which is almost

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,000
the content it's correct as it is in English it's even better but you should

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,260
try also in Spanish in French and whatsoever if you need to do so but for

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,120
instance I want to and then you can retreat this information for instance I

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,700
don't need this image I just want to get rid of them so I'm gonna go through this

62
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,860
one and clean up you know making some operations which is I'm trying to find

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,020
some structured content from PDF and then I'm doing some post-production or

64
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,580
some post-treatment so for instance this one is gonna you're gonna grab

65
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,900
everything that looked like an image and he's gonna clean up the stuff so I would

66
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,660
say this is three and I would say three okay so that's he's gonna take the just

67
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,700
the document we have created and he's gonna clean up everything inside so

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,680
you can add some stuff some reg X or whatever so ever and clean up your

69
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,200
things so he has made the job you see it's pretty quick and then you see if

70
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,100
you compare you have this has disappeared because I was not needing a

71
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,080
such a thing and it's more clean and so you can detect some pattern inside the

72
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,100
text whatsoever and then I mean consolidate your content what's for for

73
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,640
any purpose like if you want to do a rag if you want to do some exploration

74
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,920
if you don't do whatever you want and it's a very interesting way of working

75
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,440
with different combination of document you have a lot of documentation right

76
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,280
here I just explored the basic the basic of

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Mr. Ossier but you have a lot of possibility it's pretty well documented

78
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,580
except that you have to pay for it it's not so expensive but still you you if

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
you have to treat thousands of document yet it will cost a lot

80
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,560
so I will hand up this video so we're gonna go through the case to which is

81
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,520
training whisper which is not exactly training I should I should change the

82
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,840
text but at the at the beginning that was one of my ideas but I want to test

83
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,460
more different languages that's exactly what I'm saying right here in my queue

84
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,200
this is a multi language that is interest me and if you need I also have

85
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,100
some stuff about code switching okay but let's see it in the second video if you

86
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,680
like my work please subscribe to my channel and I will see you in the next video
