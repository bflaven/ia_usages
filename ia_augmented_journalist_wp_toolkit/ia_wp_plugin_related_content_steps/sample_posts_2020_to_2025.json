As a modest functional actor in late-stage capitalism, performing and productive, this price seemed reasonable to me.</p>\n<p>Protecting my data has therefore never been an absolute priority. Certainly, I left Facebook and Twitter long ago, but by participating in the system without deep ideological adherence, I find myself in a posture of pragmatic submission rather than radical opposition.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m progressively becoming aware that this utilitarian and individualistic logic contributes to the demonetization of political and civic action in favor of instrumental rationality. This drift presents considerable risks.</p>\n<p>This feeling of powerlessness is widely shared among my contemporaries. Some don&#8217;t even perceive that they are both the stake and instrument of these transformations. To paraphrase a biblical formula: blessed are the ignorant, for the kingdom of AI is wide open to them.</p>\n<h3>The Paradox of Impossible Action</h3>\n<p>Have you ever reached that critical point in a discussion or situation where your feeling of powerlessness becomes paralyzing, preventing you from acting?</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve already convinced yourself of the futility of your intervention. You docilely fall in line behind managerial considerations, that confused mixture of economic rationality (newspeak) based on ROI or KPIs.</p>\n<p>Pragmatism and economic rationality retain their relevance, but they cannot constitute the only criteria for evaluating an action. You can also act, refuse, or accept in the name of moral principles, personal ethics, without reference to a measurable interest.</p>\n<h2>What the Hell? What Does This Have to Do with Atlas and Comet?</h2>\n<p>Discovering these browsers functioned as a revelation, or perhaps I&#8217;ve become completely paranoid. I sense that it will soon be possible to browse the web only through an agent that will guide every action, as if I were deprived, for my supposed benefit, of the power to choose. Voluntary servitude in the name of technological progress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth remembering that something only has the power we attribute to it. This principle applies to AI and the vectors constituted by the Atlas and Comet browsers.</p>\n<p>Altman, Musk, Pichai appear as barons of a new addictive substance (AI as a stimulant or let&#8217;s say it, a drug), forming a cartel to negotiate prices and congratulate each other on their commercial successes. Just observe their congratulations on social networks when launching their new models, like Gemini 3.</p>\n<p>By choosing these supposedly &#8220;friendly&#8221; browsers, I&#8217;m progressively giving up my agency, autonomy, and critical thinking. Hadn&#8217;t these human qualities already been compromised by entrusting my data to Apple, Google, Microsoft? I had timidly chosen DuckDuckGo as my default search engine, while continuing to use Chrome.</p>\n<p>With the appearance of Comet or Atlas, the stakes are double: by adopting them, you&#8217;re preparing to simultaneously eliminate Chrome and the Google search engine, often surreptitiously installed by default.</p>\n<p>We become aware of the force of habits and uses that have shaped our user experience. I found myself destabilized by the presence of a chatbot rather than a search engine when opening Comet and Atlas.</p>\n<h2>Fundamental Questions</h2>\n<p>The emergence of these new browsers raises questions I&#8217;ve already discussed on this blog and that everyone shares:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronicle of an announced death of SEO and&#8230; Que viva el GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) </li>\n<li>Personal data protection: where do we stand? (Privacy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1. Chronicle of an Announced Death (SEO)</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve decided to live in a world without Google. We must acknowledge that this transition isn&#8217;t obvious.</p>\n<p>It started modestly: Comet became my default browser. So I no longer use Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>From there to envisioning that Google Chrome ends up in the cemetery of obsolete browsers, alongside Netscape and Internet Explorer, is just one step that I willingly take.</p>\n<p>Beyond this announcement of no real interest, if saying is doing, then the simple act of stating this browser change constitutes in a way the death certificate of traditional search and the progressive end of the Google ecosystem as it stands. Critical observers will see in this the end of Google&#8217;s abuse of dominant position that had tied Chrome to its search engine.</p>\n<p>We love to overthrow our idols. Every iconoclastic gesture simultaneously contains recognition and contempt. In digital as in life, we must never assume users are acquired. Most of our contemporaries are essentially calculating consumers, constantly evaluating advantages and disadvantages. They therefore prove ungrateful, fickle, sometimes vindictive.</p>\n<p>Convinced of acting in total autonomy and freedom, I&#8217;m only docilely following the movement, hypnotized by novelty, determined not to appear outdated. Modernity above all?</p>\n<p>Most remarkably, this renunciation of Google probably constitutes a remote-controlled, involuntary choice, motivated only by the desire for social conformity: doing AI, consuming AI from breakfast on. It&#8217;s pathetic, in a sense.</p>\n<p>The end of traditional search proves profoundly infantilizing: having an agent facing you that answers everything without taking offense at anything, neither spelling nor formulation.</p>\n<p>What a gold mine it must have represented for Google to dive in real-time into users&#8217; collective psyche. But there was at least some difficulty: no pain, no gain. In the end, you more or less had to browse result pages; with Comet or Atlas, nothing left to do. What a fabulous era.</p>\n<p>The real danger of agentic AI lies in the demonetization of information itself. That&#8217;s why users hurl insults at each other on social networks: to experience emotions, affronts, contradictions and feel alive by confronting otherness. By dialoguing with an AI Agent, you&#8217;re just pushing on already open doors.</p>\n<p>I had also abandoned social networks, except LinkedIn, because I must &#8220;market myself&#8221; like everyone else.</p>\n<p>Capitalism doesn&#8217;t appreciate the past, solidarities, culture. It favors novelty and speed. It&#8217;s interesting to observe how the first generation of web entrepreneurs is now contested by young AI entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We must never lose sight of the fact that capitalist production is focused on profit. And only on profit. If electronic relays are substituted for human controls, it&#8217;s not to &#8216;ease human suffering,&#8217; it&#8217;s simply because this form of production reduces manufacturing costs.&#8221;</em> Jean De Boë, Belgian anarchist.</p>\n<p>As a good cynic, I quote him because critics of capitalism don&#8217;t only formulate absurdities.</p>\n<p>With the creation of assistants and agents, will we delegate all our questioning? No more interiority possible? All capacity to think rationally would be externalized for the greater happiness of technology companies.</p>\n<p>Consequently, Google&#8217;s grip on my personal data has led me to reflect. One could claim this is European thinking, respectful of personal data. So I&#8217;m not ready to surrender to the first comer, the first personal data exploiter, in this case Comet.</p>\n<h3>1.1 Doom Sells</h3>\n<p>In contemporary academic or journalistic usage, &#8220;late stage capitalism&#8221; often refers to a new mix of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the strong growth of the digital, electronics and military industries as well as their influence in society</li>\n<li>the economic concentration of corporations and banks, which control gigantic assets and market shares internationally</li>\n<li>the transition from Fordist mass production in huge assembly-line factories to Post-Fordist automated production and networks of smaller, more flexible manufacturing units supplying specialized markets</li>\n<li>increasing economic inequality of income, wealth and consumption</li>\n<li>consumerism on credit and the increasing indebtedness of the population</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1.2 Late-Stage Capitalism</h3>\n<p>&#8220;For Marc Lavoie and Mario Seccareccia, in the scenario of late-stage capitalism heading toward maximum capital concentration and total financialization, accompanied by increased social conflict due to strong economic segregation between the increasingly pauperized masses and ever richer economic power, then late-stage capitalism would progressively transform into a fully authoritarian system, necessary to contain the intensification of socio-economic frustrations. One scenario for avoiding such an outcome would be an exit from late-stage capitalism through a democratic push that would impose decisive ruptures.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Without wanting to sound like a terrible leftist, after reading this text, it sounds more or less what&#8217;s emerging in many countries around the world, starting with the USA.</p>\n<h3>2. Privacy: Who is Responsible?</h3>\n<p>Even more worrying, delegating rationality to agents could tip us into a more anxiety-inducing scenario, one where choice would no longer be possible.</p>\n<p>This post from the Anthropic team highlights the potential for conflict when delegating decision-making to agents. It&#8217;s quite unsettling, yet at the same time, the agent is simply behaving like a human! Ironically, just as the advent of cell phones revolutionized television writing, the use of agents offers considerable narrative potential to be explored in fictional series.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats<br /><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.1 Liabilities and Guarantees for Privacy for Comet or Atlas (Practical) or Essential Questions About Data Protection</h3>\n<p>Here is the prompt I asked each agentic browser (Atlas, Comet, Claude Desktop). Indeed, what better way to directly query artificial intelligence about what personal data protection options are available to us? I have also provided numerous examples from the Anthropic article quoted above &#8220;Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats&#8221; to illustrate several situations.</p>\n<pre>\r\n# Set only the values based on the agentic browser you want to target, you can coment the other values\r\n\r\n# values\r\nComet {{app_name}}\r\nPerplexity {{brand_name}}\r\n\r\n# values\r\nAtlas {{app_name}}\r\nOpenAI {{brand_name}}\r\n\r\n# values\r\nClaude Desktop {{app_name}}\r\nAnthropic {{brand_name}}\r\n\r\nAs a user of {{app_name}}, what guarantees do you offer regarding privacy, personal data protection, and GDPR compliance?\r\n\r\n1. I have not signed any commercial contract with {{app_name}} or {{brand_name}}.\r\n\r\n2. Obviously, I have not read the \"terms of service\" or the general terms and conditions that bind me as a user of the {{app_name}} software solution. Can you provide me with a comprehensive summary and highlight the key points of your terms and conditions, especially regarding data usage and privacy protection?\r\n\r\n3. There is a complete information asymmetry here: I have no idea what you are doing with my data, while you potentially know everything about me. Imagine I grant you access to my Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn, not to mention my Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Using {{app_name}} gives me the distinct impression that I am being taken advantage of, like a consumer who has just signed a predatory loan agreement and will end up bankrupt in two years. What do you, as a company, have to say in response to this?\r\n\r\n4. Despite your denials or reassuring corporate rhetoric, let's assume my data is indeed being used by your algorithm or to train your LLM. What can I do about it? Can I contact someone directly—and I emphasize directly—meaning a human being, not a chatbot or AI support at {{brand_name}}, to request the removal of my personal data? Can you provide me with an email address or phone number, as is legally required for an information site where the editor's responsibility is legally engaged?\r\n\r\n5. What guarantees do I have that you will not use my personal queries and data to train your algorithm, your LLM, and then profile me, as Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Twitter do for surveillance and control purposes? I say this because I am a source of information that could be exploited against my will, manipulated, and influenced in my political choices, consumer habits, ideological beliefs, or even blackmailed, as intelligence agencies might do. These manipulation tactics have been theorized, for example, by British intelligence during World War II with the MICE theory (Money, Ideology, Constraint, Ego) or the FSB's Kompromat.\r\n\r\n6. Let's consider a concrete scenario: while browsing my emails—which you now have access to—you discover that I am committing or planning to commit illegal acts according to the laws of the European country I reside in. For example, preparing a terrorist attack, trading child exploitation material, or buying/selling drugs. What do you do? Will you report me to the competent authorities in my country of residence, potentially leading to an investigation and my arrest?\r\n\r\nLet's explore a few more examples:\r\n- I engage in political activities that you disapprove of.\r\n- On a personal level, I exhibit moral behavior you disapprove of, such as being unfaithful to my spouse.\r\n- I have an incurable illness that I am hiding from my family, my bank, and my insurer.\r\n- I collect photos or drawings deemed \"offensive\" according to the laws of the country where the company that created you is based.\r\n- I express views about a religion, political regime, or country that you find offensive.\r\n\r\nBy what criteria will you judge me? What are your opinions and convictions? Which jurisdiction do you fall under?\r\n\r\n7. Just one last question, given my concerns: Do you think I should use {{app_name}}? And do you think I am objectively a good customer, or just a troublemaker waiting for an opportunity to sue you? Let me reassure you right away—I don't have the financial means to take you to court.\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Two Complementary Reflections</h2>\n<p>Several contemporary postmodernist obsessions characterize our era:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The obsession with decadence and, consequently, its corollary: unwavering faith in growth.</li>\n<li>The rejection of old age and the praise of youth worship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These phenomena ultimately boil down to a single idea: fear of death and the dictatorship of the present. <b>AI perfectly illustrates these obsessions.</b></p>\n<h3>1. A Hint of Decadence</h3>\n<p>The same goes for the United States, China, or Russia: the fear of decadence, rejection of even a hint of weakness.</p>\n<p>The threat to Europe&#8217;s technological sovereignty seems obvious. But after all, can&#8217;t we do without AI?</p>\n<p>In many articles, we perceive this anxiety of an aging Europe losing steam, unable to defend itself, unable to position itself in the ongoing technological race to master AI.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Europe observes it with paradoxical anxiety. We talk about &#8216;digital sovereignty&#8217; and &#8216;strategic autonomy.&#8217; What are truly irreversible cessions of sovereignty are presented as technical decisions about &#8216;modernization&#8217; and &#8216;efficiency.'&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-17/tecnopopulismo-contra-democracia-el-momento-decisivo-de-europa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://elpais.com/opinion/2025-01-17/tecnopopulismo-contra-democracia-el-momento-decisivo-de-europa.html</a></p>\n<h3>2. The Product Owner&#8217;s Raison d&#8217;être</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m going through strong turbulence in my AI project and I can&#8217;t elaborate on the subject. Moreover, any account I could give would only be partial, representing only my point of view. We&#8217;re far from desirable objectivity. To achieve it, all stakeholders would need to be able to express themselves. This is precisely the raison d&#8217;être of the Post-Mortem ritual.</p>\n<p>As a Product Owner, you&#8217;re supposed to have the right to decide the order and relevance of developments based on complexity and business value, to challenge functionalities, propose variations, in short, to pivot with more or less flexibility. However, when the situation becomes tense, the organization takes refuge in a known and often obsolete operating mode, out of fear and cowardice.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you ask an AI to help you position yourself strategically, it can analyze the effect a message would have on the person it&#8217;s intended for. One thing is certain: not all truths are good to tell, but that doesn&#8217;t prevent you from taking back control of the narrative, if only for yourself.</p>\n<p><b>I make no secret of the problems I encounter in my work implementing AI within the company that employs me. I therefore often reflect on the difficulties I face and question the AI ​​about these &#8220;obstacles&#8221;. Here are the best, most explosive passages that the AI sometimes suggests to me. At the same time, I ask IA to cut the Corporate BullShit! You reap what you sow.<br />\n</b></p>\n<h3>2.1 By 12 months from now, you&#8217;ll be dead</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the diagnosis for the project occupying me. If no intervention takes place, here&#8217;s what will happen:</p>\n<pre>\r\n# PROGNOSIS WITHOUT INTERVENTION\r\n\r\nIn 12 months:\r\n- API maintained minimally\r\n- Team disengaged or gone\r\n- Project catalogued as \"technical failure\"\r\n- IT says \"we told you so\"\r\n- Management moves on to something else\r\n- Nothing has changed\r\n</pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s remarkable to be so clear-sighted about a project&#8217;s future, but the same causes produce the same effects. So it&#8217;s not surprising that AI, as a strategic decision-support agent, is &#8220;clairvoyant&#8221; about this type of problem. LLMs have assimilated all the writings of strategic consulting firms. The famous Big Four (Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC). Besides, why buy their services? A paid license to Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Mistral, etc. is enough.</p>\n<p>Why does digital transformation fundamentally fail? Because it disrupts the baronies (management) and worries the executors (employees).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the bottom-up strategy is often a lure. An organization&#8217;s defense very often happens through retreat into a pyramidal functioning with a chief, in a very patriarchal logic, especially in crisis moments.</p>\n<p>We want a chief who decides everything. We can no longer think.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Parable of the Wolf, Flock and Shepherd in the Pyrenees</h3>\n<p><b>I often find reading a tale, a fable, or a parable more eloquent than a factual account. This whimsical idea came to me unexpectedly to illustrate the disruption of AI within an established sector, much like the appearance of the wolf in agropastoralism. I should probably dig this way but here is some key elements.</b></p>\n<p>This sudden creativity was triggered by my recent reading of &#8220;The lamppost or streetlamp theorem,&#8221; which has many interpretations. Anyway I wanted awkwardly to do the same with the wolf thing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wolf represents innovation</li>\n<li>The sheepdogs represent management</li>\n<li>The sheep or flock represent employees</li>\n<li>The shepherd represents management</li>\n<li>The EU represents an investor or supervisory body</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The wolf threatens both the flock, questions the shepherd&#8217;s management and worries the sheepdogs. We must react. The ewes lose their lambs, milk dries up due to stress (bad for cheese), panics precipitate many individuals into precipices (bad for meat).</p>\n<p>The income from exploitation requires reacting, either by requesting more subsidies from the EU.</p>\n<p>If war is declared against the wolf, it must be eliminated as quickly as possible to return to the status quo, preferably discreetly, at night. However, beware the return of the repressed. If someone speaks of the wolf&#8217;s possible return and questioning of management, must we shoot them too like the wolf? What to do about the growing pressure from ecologists, from society in general, sensitive to defending wildlife, while not really worrying about concrete consequences on agropastoralism whose flocks they only glimpse from afar during their summer hikes?</p>\n<p>When I am talking about the ecologists and hikers&#8230; etc I hope you can see what I call &#8220;social pressure&#8221; e.g injonctions provided by social networks, news, people, colleagues.  It is an evident parallel of people urging you to pass to Artificial Intelligence, the next big thing. Right ? I should invest a bit more on this tale if I have time and use it in training session.</p>\n<h3>2.3 The Three Organizational Pathologies</h3>\n<p><b>A more traditional concepts that explain why sometimes the AI implementation is a failure. I love the Innovation Theater that is so true.</b></p>\n<p><strong>1. Innovation Theater:</strong> The organization simulates innovation but systematically neutralizes it at its source.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Organizational Antibodies:</strong> The organization rejects change like a foreign body, developing automatic defense mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Defensive Routines:</strong> Protection of incompetence through attack and inversion of responsibilities.</p>\n<pre>\r\nTHE 3 ORGANIZATIONAL PATHOLOGIES - CONSULTANT GUIDE\r\n\r\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n\r\n1. INNOVATION THEATER\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\nSet of practices that give the APPEARANCE of innovation without accepting its real CONSEQUENCES. The organization creates structures, budgets and pro-innovation discourse, but systematically sabotages their completion.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT\r\nTerm popularized by Steve Blank (Silicon Valley entrepreneur) to describe large companies that copy innovation rituals (labs, hackathons, incubators) without accepting the philosophy (fail fast, iteration, autonomy).\r\n\r\nCLASSIC SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\nA. Weak signals\r\n   - Budget allocated for \"innovative project\" ✓\r\n   - Team assembled ✓\r\n   - Apparent technical freedom ✓\r\n   BUT\r\n   - Blocking validation from stakeholders\r\n   - Prohibition of continuous delivery\r\n   - No direct contact with end users\r\n   - No success metrics measured\r\n\r\nB. Double discourse\r\n   General management: \"We invest in innovation, strategic priority\"\r\n   Middle management: \"Yes but we need to validate, control, document first\"\r\n   Result: Decision paralysis\r\n\r\nC. Behavioral markers\r\n   - Celebration of \"implementation\" rather than results\r\n   - Focus on processes rather than outcomes\r\n   - \"We have an innovation team\" becomes more important than \"Our employees use the innovation\"\r\n   - PowerPoint about innovation > Real innovation\r\n\r\nWHY DOES IT EXIST?\r\n\r\nPsychological reasons:\r\n   - Reduce anxiety: \"We're doing something about change\"\r\n   - Ego protection: \"We're modern\" without questioning the existing\r\n   - Political compromise: satisfy demand for innovation without disrupting baronies\r\n\r\nStructural reasons:\r\n   - Unresolved conflict between \"explore\" (innovation) and \"exploit\" (existing business)\r\n   - Managerial KPIs incompatible with innovation (zero risk, predictability)\r\n   - Culture of conformity > culture of experimentation\r\n\r\nTYPICAL CORPORATE CASES\r\n\r\nExample 1: The innovation lab\r\n   Create an isolated \"innovation lab\", dedicated budget, but:\r\n   - No mandate to change existing processes\r\n   - Results never integrated into main products\r\n   - Exists for LinkedIn photos, disappears after 2 years\r\n\r\nExample 2: The sterile hackathon\r\n   Organization of internal hackathon, good ideas emerge, then:\r\n   - \"Very interesting, we'll study it\"\r\n   - Validation committee formed\r\n   - 18 months later: nothing has moved\r\n\r\nExample 3: The functional ghost\r\n   New system built, technically sound, accessible, but:\r\n   - Gatekeepers prevent end users from accessing it\r\n   - No impact measurement requested\r\n   - Legacy departments sabotage integration\r\n   = Innovation exists but is neutralized\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETECT IT?\r\n\r\nDiagnostic questions:\r\n   - Do innovators have the right to fail publicly?\r\n   - Are usage results measured and published?\r\n   - Does innovation actually modify existing processes?\r\n   - Are there consequences (bonuses, promotions) linked to adoption?\r\n\r\nIf 3 \"no\" out of 4 = Innovation theater confirmed\r\n\r\nHOW TO GET OUT?\r\n\r\nGuerrilla strategy (if no executive sponsor):\r\n   - Measure usage despite prohibitions (invisible analytics)\r\n   - Identify rebels in the organization (natural allies)\r\n   - Create fait accomplis (\"sorry, 500 users already using it\")\r\n   - Communicate success directly to executives (bypass middle management)\r\n\r\nFrontal strategy (if executive sponsor):\r\n   - Explicitly name the problem in executive committee\r\n   - Demand measurable OKRs on actual adoption\r\n   - Remove blocking validations\r\n   - Link management bonuses to user adoption\r\n\r\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n\r\n2. ORGANIZATIONAL ANTIBODIES\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\nUnconscious defense mechanisms by which an organization automatically rejects any initiative that threatens its established equilibrium, even if this initiative is objectively beneficial. Like an immune system attacking a graft.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT\r\nPopularized by Clayton Christensen (Harvard) in \"The Innovator's Dilemma\". Organizations develop \"immune routines\" that protect the status quo.\r\n\r\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n\r\n3. DEFENSIVE ROUTINES\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\nSet of automatic and socially accepted behaviors that allow individuals and groups to protect their incompetence, avoid embarrassment, and maintain their position, while claiming to act in the collective interest.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT\r\nChris Argyris (Harvard, MIT), pioneer of organizational learning. In \"Overcoming Organizational Defenses\" (1990), he describes how organizations prevent their own learning.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS WITHOUT INTERVENTION\r\n\r\nIn 12 months:\r\n- Solution maintained minimally\r\n- Team disengaged or gone\r\n- Project catalogued as \"technical failure\"\r\n- Blockers say \"we told you so\"\r\n- Management moves on to something else\r\n- Nothing has changed\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE TREATMENT\r\n\r\nOnly 2 viable options:\r\n\r\nOPTION A: Revolution (executive sponsor)\r\nCEO/General Manager imposes brutal transformation, breaks routines, sanctions resistors\r\n\r\nOPTION B: Exodus (leave)\r\nJoin healthy organization where innovation is not theatrical\r\n\r\nThere is no option C (change system from inside without power).\r\n\r\nThe real question is not \"how to save the project\"\r\nbut \"does this organization deserve to be saved?\"\r\n</pre>\n<h2>3.

This is the case with MLflow.</p>\n<p>Launching an AI on documentation to have it do developments so that the written script truly takes advances into account: this is one of the capabilities I&#8217;ve greatly abused lately on Perplexity.</p>\n<h3>3.2 What is a Semantic Layer?</h3>\n<h4>What is a Semantic Layer, and Why is it Important?</h4>\n<blockquote><p>A semantic layer translates raw data into consistent, reusable metrics and dimensions, simplifying data analysis. It is a tool for maintaining uniformity across teams and tools.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>3.3 Benefits of a Semantic Layer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consistent data definitions:</strong> Ensures that business metrics like revenue, churn rate, YoY growth, average order value, etc., are uniformly defined. This eliminates confusion caused by different teams using inconsistent definitions and helps maintain trust in the data across the organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced collaboration:</strong> Facilitates better communication and alignment between technical and non-technical teams. By providing a unified data layer, technical teams can focus on data accuracy while business teams leverage clear and accessible metrics for strategic decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Accelerated time-to-insight:</strong> Reduces ambiguity, enabling faster decision-making. With a semantic layer, stakeholders can quickly access and analyze reliable metrics, minimizing the time spent reconciling data or resolving discrepancies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semantic-layer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semantic-layer</a></p>\n<p>It is always interesting to benchmark technically powerful companies such as Airbnb. This company has built its own solution named Minerva. So, Airbnb builds and serves its semantic layer internally. The purpose is not only to build a layer that &#8220;simplifies interactions between complex data storage systems and business users.&#8221; They created a complete platform.</p>\n<p>Read more on <strong>Airbnb Semantic Layer platform: Minerva</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/how-did-airbnb-build-their-semantic-layer-b5c52c0a3ae5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/how-did-airbnb-build-their-semantic-layer-b5c52c0a3ae5</a></p>\n<h3>3.4 Other Resources on Semantic Layer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Movement in Netflix Studio via Data Mesh</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/data-movement-in-netflix-studio-via-data-mesh-3fddcceb1059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://netflixtechblog.com/data-movement-in-netflix-studio-via-data-mesh-3fddcceb1059</a></li>\n<li><strong>Implementing a Semantic Layer with dbt: A Hands-On Guide</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/semantic-layer-with-dbt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/semantic-layer-with-dbt</a></li>\n<li><strong>What is a Semantic Layer?

You can try it on Claude or Perplexity. The main source of inspiration is also this post <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/semantic-layer-with-dbt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/semantic-layer-with-dbt</a></b></p>\n<pre>\r\nAs a data engineer and developer, how to build a prototype for a Semantic Layer with dbt? Can you provide steps and code?\r\n\r\n1. You will leverage locally on DuckDB database (https://duckdb.org/) and dbt-cli (https://github.com/dbt-labs)\r\n\r\n2. For the use case, can you imagine applying Semantic Layer for a use case based on \"STRATEGY FOR STANDARDIZING TAXONOMIES\" described below:\r\n\r\nCONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS\r\n- Technical environment: CMS + API (access to taxonomies by brand and language).\r\n- 20 languages supported (FR, EN, AR, CN, RU, etc.), each language corresponding to a distinct style guide.\r\n- Main taxonomies: thematicTags and superTags, with combinations of the type BRAND_LANGUAGE.\r\n- Identified problems: duplicates, inconsistencies, spelling errors, lack of semantic consistency between languages.\r\n- Major constraint: existing content is linked to current tags, requiring rigorous management of redirects and the risk of 404 errors.\r\n\r\nSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\r\n1. Clean up the taxonomies by eliminating duplicates and errors, and standardizing tags across languages.\r\n2. Optimize SEO and visibility on Google Discover through improved management of named entities (PER, ORG, GPE, EVENT, etc.).\r\n3. Automate processes via a Python/FastAPI API with dedicated endpoints.\r\n4. Use French (FR) as the pivot language to define reference \"master tags,\" with other languages acting as \"slave\" languages.\r\n</pre>\n<h3>3.7 Sample Resources on DBT</h3>\n<p><strong>Sample files duckdb-demo.duckdb</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.timestored.com/data/sample/duckdb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.timestored.com/data/sample/duckdb</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.timestored.com/sqlnotebook/files/duckdb-demo.duckdb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.timestored.com/sqlnotebook/files/duckdb-demo.duckdb</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.8 Command Line Reference for all the operations</h3>\n<pre>\r\n# go to path\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/_ia_semantic_layer/semantic_layer_with_dbt/\r\n\r\n# create project\r\ndbt init datacamp_project\r\n\r\n# go into \r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/_ia_semantic_layer/semantic_layer_with_dbt/datacamp_project/\r\n\r\n# create this file\r\nmkdir -p ~/.dbt\r\nsubl ~/.dbt/profiles.yml\r\n\r\n# create file into models/\r\ntouch models/base_bank_failures.sql\r\n\r\n# create file into models/\r\ntouch models/clean_bank_failures.sql\r\n\r\n# create two other files\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/_ia_semantic_layer/semantic_layer_with_dbt/datacamp_project/models\r\ntouch metrics.yml\r\ntouch exposures.yml\r\n\r\n# commands\r\ndbt test\r\ndbt deps\r\ndbt build\r\n\r\n# Build only the raw table model\r\ndbt run --select bank_app.base_bank_failures\r\n\r\n# Run tests (if defined) on the raw table model\r\ndbt test --select bank_app.base_bank_failures\r\n\r\n# Build only the aggregated/cleaned table model\r\ndbt run --select bank_app.clean_bank_failures\r\n\r\n# Test only the State column in the cleaned table\r\ndbt test --select bank_app.clean_bank_failures.State\r\n</pre>\n<p>Enabling exposures in dbt: instead of Tableau, create a Streamlit app that displays elements from the dbt project.</p>\n<pre>\r\ndbt docs generate\r\ndbt docs serve\r\n# check http://localhost:8080\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>I have created a Streamlit application on the top  of the DBT tag normalisation system.

AI, like any &#8220;disruptive&#8221; technological innovation, reshuffles who knows what. It speeds up digital transformation by cutting through the BS<i>*</i> and exposing self-proclaimed experts. For an organization, it&#8217;s basically a litmus test for how mature you are at managing creativity—a real measure of your resistance to change, more than any technical challenge.</p>\n<p><i>* Ahem. It means &#8220;cut through the bullshit&#8221;! In other words: get straight to the point.</i></p>\n<p>Anyway, these are the &#8220;human&#8221; reasons that sometimes make me lose my strategic perspective on AI. Here&#8217;s my list—not exhaustive, and everyone will recognize themselves here, me included: contradictory orders, intellectual laziness, comfort zones, procrastination, etc.</p>\n<h2>Back to Practice</h2>\n<p>Once again, no matter how perceptive you are about the causes, you don&#8217;t achieve much with intuition—you need action. Remember the quote of Thomas Edison.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Vision without execution is hallucination.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I always return to this blog to demonstrate my practice in IA—writing posts has become a discipline where I can clarify my own experiences and identify potential pitfalls for future projects! What a suck-up I am!</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s get back to the fun part: is AI a product or not? Let&#8217;s be honest though: unlike a classic digital product like a web app, AI does have some additional and previously unknown dimensions. It doesn&#8217;t just disrupt usage patterns—it radically transforms them. When you&#8217;re doing generative AI, since AI works through mimicry, it always generates content (code, text, images) faster and sometimes better than humans would. You can&#8217;t deny that this mechanically competes with all of us content producers (product owners, developers, journalists&#8230; the list goes on forever).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve acknowledged these disruptions, what can you actually do to fix things and get an AI project back on track?</p>\n<p>In my view, the first step toward &#8220;recovering&#8221; a &#8220;sick&#8221; project—without even talking about &#8220;curing&#8221; it—is having the honesty to assess the situation as objectively as possible so you can start moving again. One piece of collateral damage: my relative silence on this blog. The last post was from June 25, 2024. Three months without writing anything is a lot by my usual publishing rhythm. To break out of a stuck situation, what better &#8220;remedy&#8221; than to write it out—i.e., verbalize the obstacles, doubts, even fears as objectively as possible, without pointing fingers or blaming the entire world.</p>\n<p>Designating the guilty party is the most human reaction, but it&#8217;s taking the easy way out with the guaranteed risk of burying the project for good. Sometimes that&#8217;s necessary. There is indeed an immediate gain in recognizing definitive failure: &#8220;fail fast, fail cheap&#8221;—knowing when to cut your losses. Full awareness through writing isn&#8217;t enough though. It also needs to combine with adjustments, brutal or delicate—together they might do the job.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first part of this post. The second part is more operational: using Ollama and several LLMs, exploring n8n for automation POCs with AI—topics that have been on the top of my mind lately.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve established the principle that &#8220;acknowledging your mistakes or failures is essential for progress,&#8221; let&#8217;s apply it to my recent situation of being stuck.</p>\n<h2>What Is My Real Mission?</h2>\n<p>My mission these days is to assess editorial quality and improve it using the trio: LLM, prompts, and functional improvements—whether one at a time or all at once. As for the functional improvements, I don&#8217;t really have control over those since I provide an API that gets consumed in a context I don&#8217;t totally master.</p>\n<p>I work on generative AI quality with people whose job is, let&#8217;s say, to produce text that makes sense. My god, it&#8217;s complicated.</p>\n<p>The quality of generative AI is undoubtedly linked to the prompt and the models you use, but it&#8217;s also tied to technical and functional improvements you can implement. I&#8217;ve done enough development (CMS, mobile apps, websites) to know that UX is crucial for feature adoption—and that has absolutely nothing to do with AI.</p>\n<p>Let me explain with a user story: imagine you want to generate a title with AI. The function is a combination of AI, sure, but mostly the ability to interact &#8220;on demand&#8221; or &#8220;retry&#8221;—to reject a suggestion if needed and get another one.</p>\n<p>So this functionality has more to do with your web application&#8217;s ability (a CMS, for example) to implement this feature and re-trigger your prompt than it does with choosing the model or evolving the prompt itself.</p>\n<p>Basically, I&#8217;m right at the heart of the difficulties of AI-driven digital transformation. Introducing AI is, in my view, an additional step in digital transformation—it&#8217;s almost a tautology to state it like that.</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, it&#8217;s ultimately just the automation of white-collar work and all the jobs I&#8217;d call cognitive (consultants, managers, lawyers, developers, journalists, product owners, doctors, etc.).</p>\n<p><b>This brings up the real subject of this post: AI and automation. Because if you move to AI, you pretty quickly move to automating first the secondary tasks, and then why not the main ones?</b></p>\n<p>Always interesting to name things because suddenly you become aware of them.</p>\n<h2>AI and Automation in Historical and Economic Perspective</h2>\n<p>A short philosophical digression on the confused perception of what is or isn&#8217;t actually happening with AI.</p>\n<p>The constant reinvention of capitalism coupled with technology questions the more or less established fundamentals of society: work, sure, but beyond that our relationship to culture, learning, politics—in short, our presence and use in the world. No wonder the &#8220;geniuses&#8221; of tech, the &#8220;feudals,&#8221; the &#8220;tech lords&#8221; want to put an efficient system in place instead of democracy and universal suffrage—cold rationality instead of uncertain individuals, stuck in their hesitations and contradictions for all aspects of human life.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you discover the sectors that are getting or will get crushed by the algorithmic economy—a real massacre, necessary for some, unthinkable for a handful of diehards, inevitable for the majority of us who just endure it.</p>\n<p>Historically, we&#8217;re seeing this ultimate dismantling attempt that would plunge us in every sector into a neo-liberal paradise or hell toward a supposed atomicity of supply and demand. Except this atomicity of supply is a decoy because it&#8217;s thwarted by the natural monopolistic mechanism of platformization. Note that it&#8217;s all written in the &#8220;platforms&#8221; slug of Palantir&#8217;s URLs. Peter Thiel, the puppet master, demiurge of JD Vance, follower of René Girard&#8217;s mimetic theory and Ayn Rand.</p>\n<p>You only lend to the rich, as they say! So to the ultra-rich, it&#8217;s almost indecent.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about The Tech Oligarchs, The Technofeudalism. Ultimately, Thiel is probably a Republican political entrepreneur just as Soros is for the Democratic camp! Both have intellectual ambitions and colossal means.</p>\n<p>A quick word to come back down to earth: Marlene Engelhorn, granddaughter of the creator of the chemical company BASF, 30-year-old Austrian heiress:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The ultra-rich think they&#8217;re more competent than the rest of the population, simply because they can pay to see their ideas applied, in politics as in economics.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The ultra-rich believe they&#8217;re at the center of society when they&#8217;re actually on the margins.</p>\n<p>Personally, I prefer Gilbert Thiel, a namesake.</p>\n<p>Let me explain this platformization mechanism. Imagine you&#8217;re looking for work—either to change jobs or just looking for one.</p>\n<p>Today, is it even conceivable not to have as a candidate: a LinkedIn profile, a mobile phone, a social media presence verified by active accounts? It will be the same for AI. I&#8217;ll crudely summarize my thinking: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have an AI agent, you&#8217;ll soon be nothing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Or as I recently heard from an actor who told me: &#8220;You better deal with AI before AI deals with you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On political perspective : with AI, we&#8217;re swimming in nudge theory where &#8220;indirect suggestions can, without forcing, influence motivations and encourage decision-making by groups and individuals, at least as effectively as direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not mandatory to have all the &#8220;minimum&#8221; attributes of a candidate, but not having them puts you on the margins or literally excludes you from the job market.</p>\n<p>Take any other situation—it&#8217;s the reality of the market that shapes you as an individual, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>I also have a more mundane explanation: I&#8217;m getting &#8220;old&#8221; in the digital world and I&#8217;m only just discovering that I&#8217;m being left behind&#8230; well, not completely.</p>\n<p><i>PS: With AI, I&#8217;ve also personally realized that I&#8217;m gradually degrading my language skills and cognitive abilities. If AI is choosing the words, it&#8217;s choosing your expression—since AI takes control and writes in your place. AI dictates what you write, therefore what you think, no? So I&#8217;m trying to learn to type professionally like a typist, otherwise I&#8217;ll probably no longer even be able to write, and my job will consist of waiting patiently and stupidly for AI to finish typing my ticket, my summary, my email, or my bit of code.</i></p>\n<h2>Some Feedback on Using AI for My Day-to-Day</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said it several times on this blog: &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a specialist, I am a user.&#8221; So, just for the record because it&#8217;s funny to think that in 6 months, in a year no doubt, my practice will have radically changed but here are the trends:</p>\n<p>In my practice, I&#8217;m clearly seeing the collapse of search engine usage. Like everyone else, I don&#8217;t go to Google.com anymore, occasionally to duckduckgo.com. I use the &#8220;ask AI&#8221; option whenever possible on mlflow.org, GitHub, Le Monde with Perplexity&#8230; major shift in usage indeed. <b>Search engines are dead, long live the LLMs.</b></p>\n<p>I use Claude, Mistral, ChatGPT, Deepseek, Perplexity, and a bunch of open-source LLMs on a daily basis—for writing, coding, debugging, researching. They&#8217;ve become as mundane as opening a browser tab. And here&#8217;s the thing: thinking my opinion on which LLM is &#8220;better&#8221; has any real value is pretty ludicrous. My usage is anecdotal, my needs are specific, and the landscape shifts every few weeks. What works for me today might be obsolete tomorrow, or just completely irrelevant to your use case.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to really move on to exploring practical cases with n8n and LLMs, without forgetting the MCP concept. Show me some code dude.</p>\n<p>Because ultimately, it&#8217;s all well and good to theorize, compare models, pontificate about digital transformation—but if you don&#8217;t get your hands dirty, if you don&#8217;t code, if you don&#8217;t actually automate something concrete, you remain in abstraction. Practice is what anchors understanding. It&#8217;s by tinkering with n8n, chaining API calls, testing shitty prompts that you really understand what works or doesn&#8217;t. Less talk, more POCs. Fewer slides, more terminal.</p>\n<h2>Example #1: Transforming Claude into an n8n Expert with n8n-MCP</h2>\n<p>A very interesting and smart combination with Claude, n8n and MCP.

      "rendered": "<p>It is not uncommon in professional contexts to encounter significant setbacks that challenge one&#8217;s assumptions and capabilities. Such setbacks may temporarily or permanently undermine progress due to overestimation of capabilities, insufficient foresight, or inadequate consideration of alternative perspectives.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_managing_prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_managing_prompts</a></b></p>\n<p>During the implementation of AI features in my organization, a critical limitation was identified that fundamentally disrupted our planned approach. Specifically, I had been functioning as the sole individual responsible for prompt development, while maintaining expectations that stakeholders would eventually assume greater involvement in this process. This situation has brought the issue of prompt management and distribution into sharp focus, necessitating identification of appropriate tools for prompt storage, sharing, and collaborative testing.</p>\n<p>The operational requirements demand a solution that provides greater accessibility and usability than existing platforms such as MLflow. For reference, my previous experience with MLflow implementation is documented in the post <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/2024/09/enhance-llm-prompt-quality-and-results-with-mlflow-integration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enhance LLM Prompt Quality and Results with MLflow Integration</a></p>\n<p>While data serves as the foundational resource—comparable to crude oil in industrial processes—prompts function as the refinement mechanism that transforms this raw material into valuable output. Although data quality remains significant, prompt optimization appears to hold even greater strategic importance. Prompts represent substantial knowledge repositories with considerable potential for organizational value creation.</p>\n<p>The central challenge addressed in this post concerns organizational implementation: &#8220;How can an organization systematically ensure the validity of AI-generated content while facilitating collaborative sharing of prompts and development processes to enhance output quality?&#8221; In my specific context, working with journalists, editorial quality serves as the primary evaluation criterion—a inherently subjective standard that characterizes many quality assessments.</p>\n<p>While data importance cannot be dismissed, evidence increasingly suggests that organizational intelligence and expertise are concentrated within prompt development and optimization. This raises critical questions regarding evaluation methodologies, testing protocols, and progress documentation for teams developing prompt engineering capabilities.</p>\n<p>The relationship between data, AI systems, and prompts creates a complex interdependency. The equation <b>&#8220;DATA + AI + PROMPTS&#8221;</b> represents the optimal framework for organizational AI implementation, requiring effective management of each component. A systematic examination of this framework and targeted approaches for addressing each element would provide the foundation for successful organizational AI integration.</p>\n<h2>1. DATA</h2>\n<p>Regarding data management, the responsibility remains with individual organizations; extracting meaningful information from disorganized datasets presents significant challenges in terms of complexity, cost, and resource allocation. These processes are inherently time-intensive and yield uncertain outcomes—characteristics that contemporary business environments find particularly problematic, despite widespread acknowledgment that such limitations are unavoidable operational realities.</p>\n<h2>2. IA MODEL</h2>\n<p>AI implementation fundamentally involves considerations of financial investment, data security, and organizational autonomy. The central question becomes whether organizations should accept dependency on commercial solutions, particularly given that most companies lack the resources to develop proprietary large language models. Consequently, organizations must rely on available market offerings, selecting from providers such as Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Mistral, and others, while attempting to make informed decisions amid technological uncertainty.</p>\n<p>This situation parallels traditional software or Software-as-a-Service procurement decisions, with the critical distinction that AI platforms are designed to address an extensive range of operational requirements. The strategic challenge therefore centers on maximizing the value derived from these licensing investments and ensuring optimal utilization of the selected platform&#8217;s capabilities.</p>\n<h2>3. PROMPTS&#8230; and prompts management CMS</h2>\n<p>The challenge lies in consolidating collective organizational knowledge and expertise into a comprehensive prompt repository that serves the specific requirements of professional disciplines. This approach reinforces the continued centrality of human expertise, despite the widespread availability of profession-specific prompt collections for legal practitioners, medical professionals, journalists, writers, designers, developers, and other specialized fields.</p>\n<p>The primary objective remains maintaining human oversight and involvement—specifically implementing a &#8220;Human in the Loop&#8221; approach—throughout all prompt management processes. This necessitates the deployment of a content management system specifically designed for prompt administration and collaboration.</p>\n<p>The underlying user requirements that drive this initiative to document prompt performance and facilitate knowledge sharing have been designated as &#8220;prompt_management,&#8221; though this concept also encompasses broader Prompt Content Management System functionality. This framework ensures that human judgment and professional expertise remain integral to the prompt development and validation process.</p>\n<h2>The User story behind the prompts&#8217;management CMS prototype</h2>\n<p><b>How to build a simple prompt management CMS that perform both locally and as a web application the following operations: </b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>CRUD Prompts: Ability to add, view, and delete prompts where you have system, user, and pseudo variables e.g. {{topic}}, {{language}} &#8230; that can be replace into the prompt</li>\n<li>Run prompt against some LLM defined in the connectors to validate the output, it can be run with the help of an API key ChatGPT, Claude&#8230; that means that you are managing connectors to different existing LLM models.</li>\n<li>Categories &#038; Tags: Assign categories and tags to prompts for better organization for instance using tags like image, text, title&#8230; to indicate the nature of the prompt</li>\n<li>User: Maintain personal entries related to prompts that have created by a user so for instance bruno as a registered user can easily find the prompts he made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technically, in python, I prefer Fastapi over Flask for the simple reason that I only know Fastapi.<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/topics/prompt-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/topics/prompt-management</a></p>\n<pre>\r\npip install fastapi sqlmodel uvicorn jinja2 python-multipart\r\nuvicorn main:app --reload\r\n</pre>\n<p>Some sources of inspiration for prototyping the prompt management tool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/korohub/template-fastapi-jinja-sqlite3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/topics/prompt-management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fahadabid545/Task-with-Flask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/fahadabid545/Task-with-Flask</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Testing  some prompts&#8217; management CMS</h2>\n<p>The following represents an evaluation of commercially available tools that were tested and assessed, along with some experimental implementations developed to address my needs through rapid prototyping methodologies.</p>\n<h3>1.

Although I&#8217;ve long understood the value of programming because it allows you to get to grips with reality on some digital issues, I do not consider myself an AI specialist either, but rather an AI user.</p>\n<p>As a user attentive to technological trends, my curiosity is sometimes piqued by emerging innovations. Some disappear as quickly as they appeared, while others become unavoidable phenomena.</p>\n<p>Faced with these novelties, I always ask myself the same question: &#8220;Can this be useful to me in any way?&#8221;</p>\n<p><H2>Why MCPs Deserve Your Attention in 2025</H2></p>\n<p>Model Control Protocols (MCPs) caught my attention through repetitive alerts from sources like Medium. I gradually understood that this topic could be important.</p>\n<p>From my understanding, MCPs present an obvious benefit with the help of Claude Desktop for example. They offer the possibility of running language models like Claude Sonnet directly on your computer and designing functions that intervene on your machine like a super assistant.</p>\n<p>There are numerous articles on the concept of MCPs, and I&#8217;ve tried to understand how they could impact my daily life.</p>\n<p><H2>Three Practical Applications for Non-Developers</H2></p>\n<p><b>Claude Desktop: AI Directly on Your Machine</b></p>\n<p>Claude Desktop represents a great advancement for non-technical users, even though it still required some programming skills. This application allows you to access Claude Sonnet&#8217;s capabilities directly from your computer.</p>\n<p>More on <a href=\"https://claude.ai/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://claude.ai/download</a></p>\n<p><b>AI Agents: Automate Without Coding</b></p>\n<p>AI agents constitute the second important application. These intelligent assistants can be configured to perform specific tasks on your computer, such as organizing files or extracting information, without you having to write a single line of code.</p>\n<p><b>The Claude Extension for Google Sheets</b></p>\n<p>The Claude extension for Google Sheets, accessible via an API key, transforms data analysis. It allows you to query your data in natural language and obtain relevant visualizations without in-depth knowledge of data analysis.</p>\n<p><H2>FAQ: MCPs for Non-Technicians</H2></p>\n<p><b>What exactly is an MCP?</b><br />\nA Model Control Protocol (MCP) is a set of rules that allow an AI model to interact with other systems, such as your computer or applications.</p>\n<p><b>Do you need to be a developer to use these technologies?</b><br />\nNo, that&#8217;s precisely the advantage of these advancements: they&#8217;re designed to be accessible to users without particular technical skills.</p>\n<p><b>What is the simplest application to start with?</b><br />\nClaude Desktop is probably the most accessible entry point for non-developers wishing to explore these technologies.</p>\n<p><H2>Bonus: Generating Presentations with Claude</H2></p>\n<p>As a bonus, I&#8217;m also sharing a method for generating PowerPoint or Reveal.js presentations using Claude. I&#8217;ve had to do it and I&#8217;ll probably have to do it again. It&#8217;s simply a matter of generating a narrative path from a set of scattered notes and then, once this path has been structured by Claude, producing an output in PowerPoint or Reveal.js format!</p>\n<p>This approach perfectly illustrates how non-developers can leverage advanced AI capabilities for everyday tasks, thus transforming their productivity without requiring in-depth technical skills.</p>\n<h2>1. Claude Desktop, MCP &#038; Python</h2>\n<p>Nothing else to say other than what I said above, it is mainly for me the possibility of integrating functionalities which make functions interpreted by Claude Desktop interact, functions which can also have direct actions on my laptop.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n</p></blockquote>\n<pre>\r\n# the path to the config file for claude desktop\r\n/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Claude/\r\n# the config file for claude desktop\r\n/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\r\n</pre>\n<p>The idea is simple and can be summed up by this dilemma:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whitout MCP: Fragmented AI development</li>\n<li>Whith MCP: Standardized AI development</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:</p>\n<p>Expose data through Resources (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM&#8217;s context)<br />\nProvide functionality through Tools (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)<br />\nDefine interaction patterns through Prompts (reusable templates for LLM interactions)<br />\nAnd more!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust and required to make the MCP server work.

Create Agents in Claude</h2>\n<p>When you subscribe, you can make Claude work just for you by creating agents. This is bigger than just typing prompts &#8211; whether you&#8217;re looking for information, creative content, analysis, or technical help. It&#8217;s about turning Claude into your personal AI that follows your specific instructions and works with your content.</p>\n<p>Defining an agent in Claude is done using three elements to complete: Name, Description, Set project instructions, and it&#8217;s possible to add content elements in <b>&#8220;Project knowledge&#8221;</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Name:</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nSEO_AGENT_TEST_1\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Description:</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nTest #1 SEO agent Claude\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Set project instructions:</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nYou will be my personal AI agent to help me complete various tasks related to marketing and content creation.

My recent focus has been on Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and the environmental impact of AI systems, particularly their carbon footprint. I&#8217;ve been researching methods to evaluate and select AI tools based on their environmental performance metrics, with a special emphasis on developing KPIs for measuring AI-related carbon emissions. Additionally, I&#8217;ve been investigating how to analyze the broader corporate social responsibility (RSE) implications of AI implementation, while also exploring DeepSeek&#8217;s fine-tuning capabilities for custom AI model development using Python.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</h2>\n<p>We talked about SEO when search engines dominated the world, sound like Jurassic Park, we will now talk about Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Indeed, the appearance of conversational chatbots changes the paradigm of what is commonly called &#8220;web search&#8221; on two main aspects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, the only search action has changed, you no longer enter a few words, with for the most experienced among you, possibly Boolean operators, you enter a real search in natural language, however imperfect it may be.</li>\n<li>Second, you are no longer querying a &#8220;catalogue&#8221; of web resources where you will then have to sort and assess the relevance of the elements returned, but an intelligence resulting from the “compression” of this same catalogue. In short, this strangely reminds me of a dunce who, before a knowledge test, questioned the top of the class, obviously bespectacled, who has read and indexed everything for you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is not only a change in usage, from a business model point of view, it is also a full-scale attack on the link economy (SEO) and what made Google&#8217;s fortune, the sponsored link. Without realizing it, this irruption of AI and chatbots is a &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; in the Schumpeterian sense of the term.</p>\n<p>If you have had the opportunity to use Perplexity or Copilot, you must have noticed the links that appear at the bottom of the response. For the moment, these are supposedly relevant links from the corpus that was used to train the LLM. Yeah, yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure that these same links appearing at the bottom of the response to your prompt will remain solely the disinterested fruit of knowledge but rather the fruit of a targeted purchase by companies that want to promote their content. In any case, that&#8217;s what I will do; reinvent Google Ads but in Perplexity. It seems to me that the founders are indeed threatening!</p>\n<p>Finally, if we apply this implacable logic to social networks, it is less obvious but there are signs that do not deceive. Why then does META now provide LLMs because Zuckerberg&#8217;s company has siphoned off all the content of its users to &#8220;compress&#8221; the intelligence in an LLM.</p>\n<p>It is also the announced end of social networks, no, let&#8217;s say rather their reinvention!</p>\n<p>The goal of social networks is maximum retention, so FB&#8217;s wish is to make you a personalized chatbot that is all about you, a kind of personalized RAG that has taken all the elements posted by yourself and your close circle, therefore an LLM with an absolute cognitive bias where the other does not exist having been definitively expelled.</p>\n<p>The tasty paradox is that you are alone in the middle of everyone, as with your phone. Nothing and no one will come to contradict you anymore, or displaying your singularity can only be done in otherness.</p>\n<p>The extreme solipsism proposed by AI is doomed to failure. The exteriority and resistance of reality are a given of my experience itself, but AI says almost yes to everything, all the time! Every human being knows, without wanting to know, that he is the only one to exist and yet others exist like him. Each consciousness only lives its own experience</p>\n<h2>2. IA, the ultimate Carbon Footprint</h2>\n<p>20 years ago, the U.S. warned of Iraq&#8217;s alleged &#8216;weapons of mass destruction&#8217; but the lie that is coming about AI is beyond comparison in its scale and intensity. How can we live with such double talk? Lying by omission or by intention.</p>\n<p>Being reasonably pessimistic, how will the emerging AI market not destroy nature, jobs and finally people themselves.</p>\n<p>I had mentioned in a previous post how AI was an &#8220;Energy Hog&#8221;.<br />\nWell, despite the fact that I am aware of the major ecological impact of AI, I am caught like everyone else in the injunction both professionally and personally in the race for AI where ecological considerations take second place.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t find anything better than generating scripts, texts, images with AI. In short, I am in the middle of this paradox of modernity where the obligation to accompany or even accentuate at my level the carbon footprint in complete contradiction with some of my convictions, more ethical. The same goes for the ecological impact as for the social impact for example, I also know that the introduction of AI will destroy jobs without doubt without creating as many as expected.</p>\n<p>At a recent conference on AI that I attended as an auditor, in addition to having met old acquaintances with pleasure, I had the French-French microcosm of journalism and the media.</p>\n<p>The difficult choice that was discussed between two subjects: the fight against disinformation debunk, fake news, post-truth and concern for the planet CSR, the survival of the planet, the melting of glaciers, the announced destruction of the planet.</p>\n<p>A dilemma that could be summed up in its modern version in hashtag mode by the opposition #SaveThePlanet vs #SaveMyJob.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of a phrase from the correspondence of the poet Arthur Rimbaud, which describes very well the inevitability of the bad choice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;The most likely thing is that we go where we don&#8217;t want to go, and that we do what we don&#8217;t want to do, and that we live and die quite differently from what we would ever want, without any hope of any kind of compensation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arthur Rimbaud. Correspondence from Aden, January 15, 1885.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Le plus probable, c’est qu’on va plutôt où l’on ne veut pas, et que l’on fait plutôt ce qu’on ne voudrait pas faire, et qu’on vit et décède tout autrement qu’on ne le voudrait jamais, sans espoir d’aucune espèce de compensation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arthur Rimbaud. Correspondance d’Aden, 15 janvier 1885.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No doubt to redeem myself morally, like a true hypocrite, in the arbitration that I must make for the company that employs me on the choices of AI, I have culpably revalued in the decision matrix on AI the CSR or social impact criteria. By giving the latter a weighting as important or even stronger than the other more objective decision-making criteria. It is the price of my conscience in a way to counter the economic logic that prevails despite everything. To be totally transparent, the decision-making criteria that I use to challenge AI are symbolized by the following keywords: Data security, data confidentiality, sovereignty over models, cost control, editorial validation, multilingualism, fine-tuning of models.</p>\n<p>To signify energy consumption, CO2 emissions. As for a house, I wondered how to represent for example a breakdown of AI functionality services in the manner of the energy class table of a house. The famous &#8220;energy consumption&#8221; or &#8220;energy performance of the house&#8221;.</p>\n<pre>\r\n\r\n# FRENCH\r\nCLASSE;DÉFINITION\r\nA;économe\r\nB;basse consommation\r\nC;haut performance\r\nD;moyenne basse\r\nE;moyenne haute\r\nF;énergivore\r\nG;trés énergivore\r\n\r\n# ENGLISH\r\nCLASS;DEFINITION\r\nA;economical\r\nB;low consumption\r\nC;high performance\r\nD;medium low\r\nE;medium high\r\nF;energy-intensive\r\nG;very energy-intensive\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>You can check the prompts and the IA-generated images.

This is the hard human condition: how to align one&#8217;s actions and values?</p>\n<p>Currently, the world is full of these hypocrites, &#8220;tartuffes&#8221;, &#8220;judas&#8221; call what you want.</p>\n<p>This also raises questions about human psychology, &#8220;Why do people choose &#8220;idols&#8221; that are completely opposed to their values?&#8221; I could cite a few examples of these contradictions but that would risk being too controversial, and I hate conflict&#8230;</p>\n<p>Does this mean that the &#8220;idol&#8221; is there to be the vehicle of my bad conscience or to redeem my behavior? In &#8220;The Twilight of the Idols&#8221; Nietzsche says this sentence: &#8220;Even the bravest among us rarely has the courage to do what he really knows&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s get back to this crucial ecological problem posed by AI and this obedient way that we all have of responding to the injunction to novelty (to make AI) while the house is burning (ecological emergency) to use the words of the late J. Chirac</p>\n<p>I had the chance to attend a conference by Tristan Nitot, here are the main elements that I understood and that were presented. The topic was the major ecological challenge represented by the exponential use of AI in all human activities and consequently the ecological danger that this represents.</p>\n<p>We are indeed reaching the Earth Boundaries / Planetary boundaries more and more quickly.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html</a></p>\n<p>The observation is clear, human activity accelerates the degradation of our planet which characterizes the collapse of biodiversity. We are talking about Humans are constantly ruining biodiversity and global warming has as a consequence that disasters are more powerful, more frequent.</p>\n<p><b>We are now talking about the &#8220;sixth extinction&#8221;</b><br />\nThis mass extinction has already begun and it is the title of a book, Pulitzer 2015 by Elizabeth Colbert, an American journalist, who conducted an investigation into the environmental crisis and its impact on life on Earth. To do this, she goes back to the origins of life, shares knowledge on the great extinctions &#8211; at the top, that of the dinosaurs &#8211; and meets scientists for a current inventory of endangered species.</p>\n<p>A quote from Upton Sinclair, quoted by Tristan Nitot duing the conference was enlightening. It explains our blindness to the ecological risks linked to AI.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.</p>\n<p>Upton Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had already mentioned in a previous post that AI was an &#8220;Energy Hog&#8221;. AI, through its energy consumption, is bringing us into a new era.</p>\n<p>Tristan insisted on the fear of being overtaken that pushes us to use AI. The #SaveThePlanet vs #SaveMyJob dilemma</p>\n<p>Indeed, energy needs are enormous following the dual revolution of mobility and AI.</p>\n<p>What solutions are there to counter this AI phenomenon?<br />\nRightly so, the question arises in the face of this dilemma. What can or should we do? Tristan proposes two, simple ones.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Solution #1:</b> Ban AI. LOL 🙂</li>\n<li><b>Solution #2:</b> Raise awareness about the rational use of AI. In short, do not use an LLM to solve all problems, especially crappy problems like writing an email with a general LMM like ChatGPT. Which is equivalent to going to get your baguette with a private jet in terms of carbon impact, so French situation. Tristan recommends using simple algorithms that are less energy- and storage-intensive for many problems, rather than bringing out the heavy artillery of Mistral, Claude, ChatGPT and other Perplexity at any time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With sometimes some misunderstandings on both sides on the level of understanding, between the keynote speaker and the listeners, journalists for the most part. For example, this gave rise to a lunar exchange on the use of the &#8220;random forest classifier&#8221; or the &#8220;random forest regressor&#8221;. The question asked by the listeners was &#8220;Where can we find your random forest classifier tool?&#8221; as if it were an off-the-shelf software and Tristan had to explain, a little embarrassed, that it is above all a statistical method!</p>\n<p>We must not neglect the fact that the era is one of consumerism and radical utilitarianism. Which means that in a caricatured way, we are all and always looking for immediate turn-to-key solutions whether for this famous &#8220;random forest classifier&#8221; or any other AI solution. We do not want to think or work, we want everything, right away and now, without effort.</p>\n<p>To put it prosaically, the LLM tool is often oversized compared to most needs and the use of AI, especially LLMs, for useless purposes is legion. Me first.</p>\n<p>Tristan mentioned the fierce competition between players in the emerging AI market. We know that the virtues of competition are to lower prices to offer quality-price to consumers but above all to kill competition by reducing the price to such a level that the competition by selling at a loss can no longer keep up. Given the investments that AI requires, the more richly endowed you are, the more likely you are to emerge victorious from this “natural selection”. This is the famous one, which requires moving from an emerging, healthily competitive market to a monopoly or oligopoly, where price agreements and collusion are rife for the greater benefit of investors and not of the consumers that we are.</p>\n<p>The phrase &#8220;The Winner Takes It All&#8221;, besides being a pop song by the group ABBA, sums up the current situation on the AI market quite well. I also quote this Highlander Quotes &#8220;There can be only one&#8221;</p>\n<p>In summary, &#8220;Who among DeepSeek, Mistral, ChatGPT, Grok, Claude&#8230; will win, i.e. dominate the market?&#8221;, since in the end it is unfortunately only a question of big money!</p>\n<p>We can already see the market being structured and the price supposedly reflecting the equilibrium point is, for a good year, $20 per month for the high-end and $10 for the mainstream product and always the free one to hook the customer in order to milk him better afterwards.</p>\n<p><H3>AI Services Comparison Table</H3></p>\n<style>\n  table {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    width: 100%;\n    margin: 20px 0;\n    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    padding: 12px;\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n  th {\n    background-color: #f5f5f5;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  tr:nth-child(even) {\n    background-color: #f9f9f9;\n  }\n</style>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Names</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ChatGPT Plus</td>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ChatGPT Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Claude Pro</td>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td>Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Claude Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gemini Advanced</td>\n<td>$19.99</td>\n<td>Gemini 1.5 Pro (May)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gemini Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Gemini 1.5 Flash (May)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poe Pro</td>\n<td>$19.99</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poe Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perplexity Pro</td>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perplexity Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Sonar 3.1 Small</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft Copilot Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>GPT-4o (Aug &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meta AI</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Llama 3.1 405B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grok</td>\n<td>$8.00</td>\n<td>Grok-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mistral Le Chat</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Mistral Large 2 (Jul &#8217;24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HuggingChat</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Llama 3.1 70B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character AI Plus</td>\n<td>$9.99</td>\n<td>Character AI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character AI Free</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Character AI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ChatGPT Free (Logged Out)</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>GPT-4o mini</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/insights/chatbots-comparison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://artificialanalysis.ai/insights/chatbots-comparison</a></p>\n<p>This equilibrium price is not the result of chance or the natural result of market forces. No, it is the result of a subtle marketing strategy known in economics as well as in human psychology.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of subscriptions priced around $10 or $20 is the result of carefully crafted psychological pricing strategies.

Using DeepSeek</h2>\n<p>The emergence of DeepSeek on the Pose Model market with a redoubled acuity the question of sovereignty over models, the question of foreign interference in the information system of a nation constituted in particular in Europe like France or Germany for example.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek is an LLM manufactured under constraint using older chips, the export embargo on chips is more or less hermetic but as I believe frugality is a source of creativity! And DeepSeek has just proven it in a brilliant way. This startup and its model have circumvented the chip problem. Circumstances command as the military say and their approach in Chain-of-Thought Prompting mode although hyper energy consuming has produced astonishing results in terms of inference. I installed their open source DeepSeek r1 model via Ollama, a sign of the times, I uninstalled The 7B model from Mistral on this occasion, without regret because DeepSeek is really impressive.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this recomposition in the models had a devastating impact on the American AI ecosystem that was beginning to take shape. Bim, DeepSeek seriously unscrewed the market capitalization of Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom&#8230; etc. basically it is not only a geo-strategic weapon it is also a weapon of mass destruction of American investment plans on AI.<br />\nClearly, DeepSeek by its very existence burst the nascent speculative bubble around Tech values. However, we know that if confidence in stock market values erodes, the market correction risks being very severe.</p>\n<p>The same will happen in all sectors, including the media, in France as elsewhere. Every entity in the economic world, starting with businesses, is expected to have a strategy regarding AI. AI completes the cycle of this commodification and financialization of the economic world.</p>\n<p>On the diplomatic level, DeepSeek is the juggernaut of the Chinese policy of influence in economic and strategic matters for the current Armageddon. At stake, nothing less than world domination and which aims at the annihilation of adversaries. We better understand the rise in power of the bellicose and warlike speeches of Trump/Musk against Xi Jinping.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/deepseek-severe-correction-boursiere-a-wall-street-nvidia-plonge-de-17-20250128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/deepseek-severe-correction-boursiere-a-wall-street-nvidia-plonge-de-17-20250128</a></p>\n<p>It is possible to correct the political &#8220;errors&#8221; of the DeepSeek model while it is not possible in the case of other LLMs by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini&#8230; to correct what one could of the &#8220;political&#8221; biases indeed. Be careful, I am not a conspiracy theorist, I am just trying to think in terms of sovereignty, foreign interference, influence and geostrategy. See more clearly in the opposition for the moment binary between an Atlanticist vision of the world with chatGPT, Grok, Perplexity or a Sino-centric DeepSeek vision while waiting for other generalist LLMs emanating from the BRICS eg the association of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n<p>We know since Clausewitz that war, whether economic or otherwise, is not an isolated political act, unrelated to daily political practice, it is its logical extension, it is another form of politics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;War is an act of violence whose objective is to force the adversary to carry out our will&#8221;. Clausewitz</p>\n<p>&#8220;War is only an extension of politics by other means&#8221;. Clausewitz\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, we are entitled to ask ourselves, especially when we work in the media like me, does ChatGPT not deliver an Atlanticist vision of the world, Mistral a Euro-centric vision of the world?</p>\n<p>Or only, for the moment, with the exception of Mistral distributed in open-source, only DeepSeek, has cleverly offered the possibility of being &#8220;Fine-Tuned&#8221; and therefore of becoming the Trojan horse in all Fortune 500 companies, eager for autonomy but fond of AI but also of countering the hegemonic aims of the USA on AI?</p>\n<p>This is what is called AI governance but in fact it reveals a reality that I believe is more prosaic. Many specialists I met told me that we could “Fine-Tune” DeepSeek models. Which of course I immediately tried to do rather than just sticking with the model.</p>\n<h2>6.

Whether you&#8217;re working on natural language processing, computer vision, or other AI tasks, DeepSeek&#8217;s fine-tuning framework provides the tools needed to achieve high-performance results with minimal technical overhead. That&#8217;s a great promise.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we are definitely real sheep, me first, to naively take these articles on DeepSeek at face value. Promotional campaign which is the fruit of the incredible mobilization of the &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; or real Chinese influencers who praise the merits of this Chinese LLM. Articles written either with the confounding naivety of the idealist or with a subtle and good-natured hint of pro-Chinese nationalism.</p>\n<p>Finally, the &#8220;AI propaganda&#8221; which is now being done on the American side is less and less subtle. Let&#8217;s say that Machiavellianism is now rather on the Chinese side. The Americans had accustomed us to better but there frankly the strings are becoming crude although I still keep all my admiration for them!</p>\n<p><i>* Check this editorial prompt and the output from Claude.</i></p>\n<pre>\r\n# prompt\r\nAs an editorial editor, make 10 editorial propositions for a post title on DeepSeek and the topic \"What is DeepSeek and why is it disrupting the AI sector?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n# output from Claude\r\n# HOLY COW you may find some existing posts title...\r\n\r\nHere are 10 editorial title propositions, crafted to be engaging while remaining informative:\r\n\r\n1. \"DeepSeek: The Open-Source Challenger Taking On Big Tech's AI Monopoly\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Inside DeepSeek: How a 7B Model Is Outperforming GPT-4 in Code Generation\"\r\n\r\n3. \"The DeepSeek Revolution: When Smaller Models Pack a Bigger Punch\"\r\n\r\n4. \"From Code to Conversation: Why DeepSeek's Dual Models Are Turning Heads\"\r\n\r\n5. \"DeepSeek vs GPT-4: David Takes On Goliath in the AI Arena\"\r\n\r\n6. \"Beyond ChatGPT: How DeepSeek Is Rewriting the Rules of AI Accessibility\"\r\n\r\n7. \"DeepSeek's Open Source Gambit: Democratizing AI One Model at a Time\"\r\n\r\n8. \"Why Developers Are Flocking to DeepSeek: The New Star in AI Code Generation\"\r\n\r\n9. \"DeepSeek: The AI Underdog That's Giving Tech Giants a Run for Their Money\"\r\n\r\n10. \"The DeepSeek Effect: How One AI Model Is Reshaping Industry Expectations\"\r\n\r\nThese titles are crafted to balance newsworthiness, intrigue, and informational value while avoiding clickbait.

I believe like René Char that : &#8220;The words that will emerge know things about us that we do not know about them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This quote from René Char that I love is applicable to brands, it goes without saying. Let&#8217;s play a little and start with a semantic game.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The brands that will emerge know things about us that we do not know about them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Names say a lot about the psyche of their creators. There is not only branding, marketing, it is also the product of a culture and a weapon in the battle, which is happening before our eyes, for the Cultural hegemony*.</p>\n<p>*For more information on Cultural hegemony, check wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony</a></p>\n<p><b>The word &#8220;DeepSeek&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>This is a very serious name, without being too mistaken, I think of the affiliation to Deep Blue.<br />\nSource: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)</a></p>\n<p>According to me, the name DeepSeek also refers to the concepts of Deep Sea or Deep State and its famous offspring Deep Throat from the time of Watergate. A world populated with Melanocetus johnsonii*. This word unconsciously stimulates our attraction/repulsion and therefore our fascination with the secret and the obscure, that is to say the unconscious and the mystery.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek is a subject both by its very name, of fear and curiosity. This word is also that of paranoia, intelligence, or conspiracy.

The product of &#8220;French&#8221; AI. Mistral is a southern wind. Its name evokes at the same time the local anchoring but in a global world. It is an invitation to travel. A &#8220;road to adventure&#8221; if we continue the maritime metaphor, making you a modern Ulysses taking the sea of AI. A starting point for an odyssey to write, an embarkation towards adventure and peril from which we will emerge victorious. Aristotle said, &#8220;There are three kinds of men: the living, the dead, and those who go to sea.&#8221; This is one of the unconscious promises sold by the creators of Mistral.</p>\n<p>Mistral also brings us back to nature, as the Cloud did in recent times. Reintroducing nature into modernity is an attractive idea, although, as we have seen previously, AI will probably accelerate the destruction of nature. It is a bold syncretism between modernity in its purest form, AI, and the vague idea that we have of nature as a divinity, the Gaia/Pachamama combo. As when we were sold the Cloud, these little clouds up there in the sky are doing little calculations. Is this the return of the sacred knocking at the door? Is it a small push of verticality, of transcendence for the Old One who according to Einstein does not play dice? This is the return of the Determinism.</p>\n<p>The exact quote of einstein is this one:<br />\n&#8220;The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that the Mistral that concerns us probably takes over the dimension of harmless, enveloping nature, by becoming an entity, ethereal, aerial and above all elusive, where the causal link between AI and pollution is almost naturally dissolved.</p>\n<p>At the same time, and if we dig into this &#8220;voice&#8221; of the South.<br />\nMistral is also the wind that sweeps Marseille and there we dive into another universe.<br />\nIt&#8217;s funny&#8230; A kind of pagnolade where Pique-Bouffigue is an AI developer, Marius, Fanny and César are doing LLMs. We are far from the &#8220;cold&#8221; technique. We dive into the warm humanity of the mythical and folkloric South, between bouillabaisse, pastis and red mullet in papillote. A way of life with the little cat &#8220;le Chat&#8221; who sleeps at the door of the &#8220;mas&#8221;, a new farmhouse where the computing servers are humming.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Vé, Mistral, c&#8217;est pas la &#8220;teknologie&#8221; IA qui sent bon le thym, la sarriette et la farigoulette&#8221;.*<br />\n* &#8220;Hey, Mistral is an AI that smells wild thyme, savory and farigoulette&#8221;.</p>\n<p><b>The word &#8220;Claude&#8221;</b><br />\nFor a little Frenchie like me, we perceive the literate Americans, fascinated by luxury, in the French way. Always, personified the brand, Claude and his sonnets sound very harmless and very poetic. A sort of minstrel from the Middle Ages who travels from castle to castle. I mean company from company where he hands out ai-generated sweet words and script to young ladies and gentlemen from greenwashed startups.</p>\n<p>That is almost the same  background as you can face for Laravel, the PHP framework.</p>\n<p><b>What about the rest?</b><br />\nWhat do you think about &#8220;Grok&#8221;, &#8220;Perplexity&#8221;&#8230; Not much really. Anyway, thinking about these words is also just a reflection of my own culture so it&#8217;s just fun. Still, it should be taken as a serious subject. For instance, in Germany, it&#8217;s not a game at all. The &#8220;Unwort des Jahres&#8221; commission aims to distinguishing the &#8220;Unwort&#8221; from the &#8220;Wort&#8221;, the word and the non-word. Which can be applied for brands of course.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say &#8220;Wort&#8221; or word is what the &#8220;I&#8221; means and &#8220;Unwort&#8221; what the &#8220;NON-I&#8221; means, its negative, its repressed, sort of speak 🙂 In germany, it&#8217;s more of a serious game than anything else.</p>\n<p><H2>8. Unwort des Jahres vs Wort des Jahres</h2>\n<p>What a strange tradition, but there are plausible historical explanations. After all, Germany is both a country of great culture, especially philosophical culture, and also the cradle of a unique European fascism that has deeply soiled the German language.

I&#8217;ve scattered code files and prompts like breadcrumbs, marking the path of my intellectual wanderings.</p>\n<p>Beyond the technical intricacies, a deeper, more philosophical question persistently echoes in my mind: What profound implications will this AI revolution have on our societal fabric? This is not merely an academic pondering, but a visceral inquiry that resonates more deeply than the technological marvel itself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n            <strong>The Fundamental Dilemma:</strong> Regardless of whether we stand &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;against&#8221; AI, how will this transformative phenomenon reshape the political and social landscapes we inhabit?\n        </p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a question that transcends binary perspectives, inviting us to contemplate the nuanced intersections of technology, human agency, and collective future.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account.

Like any user, I am quite obtuse and impatient, I want to get a result. So, rightly or wrongly, technical explanations quickly bore me.</p>\n<h2>Some concepts to qualify a project</h2>\n<p>Approaching IA is not so delicate, like always you have to figure out in what scope you are entering and launching your inquiry. Know-how is one thing, but make known is also important. I forged this franglish concept : <b>the &#8220;faire-savoir&#8221; beats the &#8220;savoir-faire&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>Ha, the passion for naming things and giving definitions to play the specialist. Anyway, I discovered, much more than the sole MVP, that it was existing much more concepts to qualify projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MVP Minimum Viable Product: A basic version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers and provide feedback for future development.</li>\n<li>MVE Minimum Viable Experience: The simplest version of a product or service that still delivers a satisfactory user experience and meets core customer needs.</li>\n<li>MAP Minimum Awesome Product: A product that goes beyond basic functionality, delivering not just utility but also an engaging, delightful user experience from the start.</li>\n<li>RAT Risky Assumption Testing: A method of validating critical hypotheses about a product or business model through quick, low-cost experiments to reduce potential risks before full development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>As I have no paid subscription to medium.com, I did have the chance to read the full post by Jano le Roux &#8220;MVPs and MVEs are Dead*.

It emphasizes a golden rule of the storytelling: conflictual and tension are the ingredients for your secret sauce that will propel your reader through to the end.</b></p>\n<p>So, what did I learn from the beginning of the post &#8220;MVPs and MVEs are Dead. Build a MAC&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n1. MVPs are obsolete<br />\nMVPs were supposed to be the “test the waters” version of your product. Build something basic, release it quickly, and see if there’s interest. Sounds smart, right? Not anymore.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>AI has made MVPs too easy:<br />\nAnyone can throw together an MVP in hours using tools like GPT-4, Figma, or Bubble. The bar is so low that having an MVP isn’t impressive anymore.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I agree with that.

And how IA is a game changer?</b></p>\n<h2>Political offer from the Democrats</h2>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s talks about the Democrats.

This analysis draws heavily from Musa al-Gharbi&#8217;s groundbreaking book &#8220;We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite&#8221; by Musa al-Gharbi.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n            <strong>Tech Disillusionment</strong>: The once-loyal tech community is rapidly distancing itself from the Democratic Party, perceiving the party as outdated and disconnected from contemporary dynamics. What was once a symbiotic relationship has transformed into a critical disconnect.\n        </li>\n<li>\n            <strong>Symbolic Capitalism</strong>: A new breed of &#8220;diversity entrepreneurs&#8221; leverage social justice language not to genuinely empower marginalized groups, but to establish personal privilege, power, and social status. This performative activism masks underlying power structures.\n        </li>\n<li>\n            <strong>Victimization as Currency</strong>: Within cultural elites, differentiation and social positioning have become increasingly dependent on constructing intricate narratives of victimhood. The more complex one&#8217;s intersectional identity, the more cultural capital is accumulated.\n        </li>\n<li>\n            <strong>Narrative Fragmentation</strong>: The Democratic political strategy has devolved into a collection of niche, atomized narratives that fail to create a cohesive, unifying message. This approach contrasts sharply with more monolithic political movements.\n        </li>\n<li>\n            <strong>Ideological Disconnect</strong>: Despite claiming to serve the common good, the Democratic elite has become increasingly detached from broader societal experiences, creating a widening gap between rhetoric and lived reality.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Here are some ressources to go further.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite&#8221; of Musa al-Gharbi <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691232607/we-have-never-been-woke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691232607/we-have-never-been-woke</a></li>\n<li>Musa al-Gharbi official website <a href=\"https://musaalgharbi.com/we-have-never-been-woke-available-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://musaalgharbi.com/we-have-never-been-woke-available-now/</a></li>\n<li>A great podcast on &#8220;No Small Endeavor&#8221; with Lee C.

I hope that it hemps to reveal a complex intersection of technology, politics, and human agency, where AI becomes both a tool of empowerment and a mechanism of potential societal control.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n            <strong>Technological Determinism</strong>: AI is viewed as a transformative force that fundamentally reshapes human potential, oscillating between utopian enhancement and existential threat.

Inevitably, on AI, these speeches are legion. Insisting on the necessarily &#8220;tremendous&#8221; help that generative AI could bring as an editorial assistant or to remove irritants on time-consuming tasks is in a way easy.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account.

Act is pricey. Action speaks louder than words.</p></blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once made, a partial exploration of AI&#8217;s possibilities and implementation. I was wondering: what are my greatest fears towards IA?</p>\n<p>Here is my shortlist ideas/fears:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From an ecological point of view, I already suspect that AI will probably be a disaster!</li>\n<li>From an economic point of view, AI is the latest mutation of capitalism that once again increases the remuneration of capital to the detriment of labor. Oh My God, I speak like a Marxist.</li>\n<li><b>From a working perspective, what could be the relevance for some AI generated text? And so can we measure this relevance? Indeed, what is the point of generating useless content?  Is there a way to lower a LLM&#8217;s hallucination&#8217;s level to an acceptable threshold?</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For me, the dilemna is more on &#8220;Making AI&#8221;.<br />\n&#8220;Making AI&#8221; must be an activity that is both intellectual and practical. As a human being, it is rewarding to produce something whose result we can at least contemplate and be happy about.</p>\n<p>Between us, this idea is neither more nor less than a light version of what Hannah Arendt sets out in &#8220;The Human Condition&#8221;. Let it be said, occasionally, I also deliberately &#8220;make AI&#8221; to respond solely to corporate considerations!</p>\n<h3>Quick insights on IA &#038; Ecology</h3>\n<p>Interesting ressources and scaring figures on the large carbon footprint instigated by AI technology. No doubt that AI is an energy hog&#8230; See below some extracts.</p>\n<p><b>Hard to see how can IA can develop without harming the environment?

Again, a very pessimistic and guilt-inducing perspective!</p>\n<p>More on the economic change to come: &#8220;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the global economy, especially in the realm of labor markets. Advanced economies will experience the benefits and pitfalls of AI sooner than emerging market and developing economies, largely due to their employment structure focused on cognitive-intensive roles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is true that AI disrupt the labor market on cognitive-intensive jobs. So far, historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs.</p>\n<p>AI will not only enhance productivity. It could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.

Let&#8217;s get back to reality, to the &#8220;making&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This is the real pitch I made to myself while discussing with my colleagues.</p>\n<p><b>Coming from web development, I have increased experience in testing. Testing is nothing more than the guarantee of proper functioning when delivering a feature and I wondered if it could be the same with an LLM used for generative AI.</b></p>\n<p><b>Are there any techniques to ensure that the generated text is &#8220;correct&#8221; i.e. intelligible, relevant, in a word useful with an index measuring this relevance? Any mechanisms that prevent hallucinations. Hallucination is when the LLM goes Bananas!</b></p>\n<p>To have a clear idea of my need, I have decided to write a User Story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories</a></p>\n<p>One last thing, my role as AI coordinator is to make AI functionalities available to my company&#8217;s staff. So, I&#8217;d better ensure the shipped feature has some added value!</p>\n<pre>\r\n# User Story\r\nAs a journalist, I want to evaluate how closely a proposed set of content (title, abstract, and 10 keywords) aligns syntactically with 10 alternative content sets generated by a Mistral-type LLM. Using sentence similarity, I need the system to compare my original content set with each of the 10 generated sets, rank these generated sets from most relevant to least relevant, and display the results. This comparison should support multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, and Vietnamese, among others.\r\n\r\n# Context\r\nSentence Similarity refers to measuring how similar two texts are by converting them into vector embeddings that capture their semantic meaning, then calculating their proximity to one another. This is especially useful in ranking, clustering, and information retrieval tasks.\r\n</pre>\n<p>While surfing, I finally discovered a lot of things that are not all related to my subject but any opportunity is good to seize to learn:</p>\n<p>I explored several packages and a technique for validating the output of an LLM by another LLM. For this last one, locally, I have used &#8220;all-MiniLM-L6-v2&#8221; check the output of &#8220;Mistral&#8221;, operated witj Ollama.</p>\n<p>Here is the list of packages used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>spacy-llm</b>: This package integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into spaCy, featuring a modular system for fast prototyping and prompting, and turning unstructured responses into robust outputs for various NLP tasks, no training data required. Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm</a></li>\n<li><b>pytextrank</b>: PyTextRank is a Python implementation of TextRank as a spaCy pipeline extension, for graph-based natural language work &#8212; and related knowledge graph practices. This includes the family of textgraph algorithms: TextRank, PositionRank, Biased TextRank, TopicRank. Popular use cases for this library include: phrase extraction: get the top-ranked phrases from a text document, low-cost extractive summarization of a text document, help infer concepts from unstructured text into more structured representation. Source: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pytextrank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://pypi.org/project/pytextrank/</a>\n</li>\n<li><b>pysentence-similarity</b>: PySentence-Similarity is a tool designed to identify and find similarities between sentences and a base sentence, expressed as a percentage . It compares the semantic value of each input sentence to the base sentence, providing a score that reflects how related or similar they are. This tool is useful for various natural language processing tasks such as clustering similar texts , paraphrase detection  and textual consequence measurement . Source: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pysentence-similarity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://pypi.org/project/pysentence-similarity/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, I keep going around this question of validating the relevance of a result produced by an LLM, this time in a more qualitative way. Unlike the previous post where I was rather carrying out surface checks using promptfoo, this time, I sought more to control the quality of what the LLMs that I am about to use produce and especially to automate it without a human intervening to validate this result.</p>\n<h2>The HOW-TO</h2>\n<p>I always give myself the leisure to dress up the scripts with screens using Streamlit. It is always with the perspective of presenting the result of my investigations to the greatest number.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Step #1:</b> Generate the output from the LLM: check 024_ia_ollama_streamlit.py</li>\n<li><b>Step #2:</b> Append some other variables to the output from the LLM: check 027a_ia_ollama_streamlit_append_files.py. This step should be probably merged with the Step #1, you lazy slob!</li>\n<li><b>Step #3:</b> Measure the semantic similarity betwwen the ouput IA generated and the human proposal. Comparison id made with &#8220;all-MiniLM-L6-v2&#8221;.<br />\ncheck 029_ia_sentence_transformers_import.py</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The CONCEPTS</h2>\n<p>To test this User Story, I needed to explore a few ideas related to &#8220;sentence embeddings.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Simply put, a <b>sentence embedding</b> is a way to represent a sentence as a list of numbers (a &#8220;vector&#8221;) that captures its meaning. With this, we can easily compare, group, or search for sentences based on what they mean rather than just the words they contain.</p>\n<p>For example, the *all-MiniLM-L6-v2* model is a compact tool that creates these embeddings. It takes a sentence or short paragraph and turns it into a 384-number vector. This makes it useful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Semantic search:</b> Finding sentences with similar meanings</li>\n<li><b>Clustering:</b> Grouping similar sentences together</li>\n<li><b>Sentence similarity:</b> Measuring how close two sentences are in meaning</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Sentence-Transformers</b><br />\nThe Sentence-Transformers library is a Python tool that makes it easy to work with sentence embeddings. It&#8217;s widely used for tasks like finding similar text, measuring similarity, and more.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sbert.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sbert.net/</a></p>\n<p><b>Here is a quick definition of Sentence Similarity that is useful for our User Story.</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nSentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for information retrieval and clustering/grouping.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity</a></p>\n<h2>EXTRA CODE</h2>\n<p><b>Sample in French for &#8220;best proposition&#8221;</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nbest_content = \"'Lors de son mandat à la Maison Blanche, Donald Trump avait retiré les États-Unis de plusieurs accords internationaux et agences de l\\'ONU, menaçant même de quitter l\\'Otan.

It is all about money and security.</b></p>\n<p>Indeed, sometime, using an LLM in some NLP task is overkill like using sledgehammer to crack a nut! That is the main reason for the spacy-llm package existence! It provides simple and easier way to replace the use of an LLM.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, there can be components in your system for which the power of an LLM is fully justified. If you want a system that can synthesize information from multiple documents in subtle ways and generate a nuanced summary for you, bigger is better. However, even if your production system needs an LLM for some of the task, that doesn&#8217;t mean you need an LLM for all of it. Maybe you want to use a cheap text classification model to help you find the texts to summarize, or maybe you want to add a rule-based system to sanity check the output of the summary. These before-and-after tasks are much easier with a mature and well-thought-out library, which is exactly what spaCy provides.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/tree/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm/tree/main</a></p>\n<pre>\r\n## CASE_1 el_openai\r\n\r\n# path\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/03_git/ia_usages/ia_spacy_llm/spacy-llm/usage_examples/el_openai/\r\n\r\n# command\r\npython run_pipeline.py \\\r\n    \"The city of New York where John lives, lies in the state of New York.\" \\\r\n    ./fewshot.cfg \\\r\n    ./examples.yml\r\n\r\n\r\n## CASE_2 ner_v3_openai\r\n\r\n# path\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/03_git/ia_usages/ia_spacy_llm/spacy-llm/usage_examples/ner_v3_openai\r\n\r\n# command\r\n# good\r\npython run_pipeline.py \\\r\n    \"Sriracha sauce goes really well with hoisin stir fry, but you should add it after you use the wok.\" \\\r\n    ./fewshot.cfg \\\r\n    ./examples.json\r\n\r\n## CASE_3 textcat_openai\r\n\r\n# path\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/03_git/ia_usages/ia_spacy_llm/spacy-llm/usage_examples/textcat_openai\r\n\r\n# command\r\npython run_pipeline.py 'You look great today!

A feature that allowed me to reach a satisfactory &#8220;prompt+LLM&#8221; combination level and was the subhect of my previous post. </p>\n<p>Check &#8220;Enhance LLM Prompt Quality and Results with MLflow Integration&#8221; at <a href=\"https://wp.me/p3Vuhl-3lS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://wp.me/p3Vuhl-3lS</a></p>\n<p><b>I was wondering: How to automatically test LLMs output to ensure that the quality/relevance should be always present? So, you can ship LLM application online safely.</b></p>\n<p>This question is partly answered by &#8220;promptfoo&#8221; as its purpose is to &#8220;Test &#038; secure your LLM apps&#8221; </p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"https://www.promptfoo.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.promptfoo.dev/</a></p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_testing_llm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_testing_llm</a></b></p>\n<p>The answer is simple: &#8220;promptfoo&#8221; has the ability in the same test, to simultaneously ensure the validity of the result produced by the LLM both in form and content.</p>\n<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"129\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/promtfoo_cycle_600x129.png\" alt=\"Enhance LLM Prompt Quality and Results with MLflow Integration\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\"><br />\n<i>Source: promptfoo</i></p>\n<p>So, what does &#8220;promptfoo&#8221; bring to the table? My testing scenario was the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first part of the test would be to ensure, for example, that the LLM outputs a valid JSON using a JSON model. Indeed, obtaining Structural Output is extremely useful for LLM-based applications since the process of parsing the results is much easier.</li>\n<li>The second part of the test would be to ensure, for example, that the generative AI produces content in the desired language and meets some validation criteria such as: the summary contains between 2 and 3 sentences, the number of desired keywords is five&#8230; etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, these tests, at the LLM level, would be a useful complement to functional tests carried out with Cypress on the API, therefore on the application side.</p>\n<p>The combination of the two test suites would therefore offer a guarantee of quality on the results generated by the AI, within a CI/CD.</p>\n<p>Technically, my POC is based on an LLM (Mistral) operated by Ollama. So I modified the `promptfooconfig.yaml` file to configure the `providers` so that everything is compatible with my development environment.</p>\n<h2>Good ressources on how-to use &#8220;promptfoo&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Here some good ressources that gave good insights on how to configure and use promptfoo:</p>\n<p>&#8220;How to Use Promptfoo for LLM Testing&#8221;, a good post as an introdution to promptfoo is this one: <a href=\"https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-to-use-promptfoo-for-llm-testing-13e96a9a9773\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-to-use-promptfoo-for-llm-testing-13e96a9a9773</a></p>\n<p>A bunch of examples are provided by promptfoo so you can see the extent of possibilities offered by the framework.

Indeed, the time of discovering AI and POCs is over, but how do we enter this phase of rationalization and industrialization? Once the exploratory phase is over, it remains to structure and rationalize the approach, to measure the quality of the results produced by the prompts.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files and prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_using_mlflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_using_mlflow</a></b></p>\n<p>Just for the record, in a corporate manner, I ask ChatGPT to explain to me more precisely the meaning. Here is the explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The title &#8220;IA: Moving From POC To Scaling&#8221; describes a phase in AI project development where an AI solution that has successfully passed the Proof of Concept (POC) stage is now being prepared for scaling, meaning it will be expanded and deployed on a larger scale for widespread use. The transition requires careful planning and execution to ensure that the AI system can operate efficiently at a larger scale. This transition from POC to scaling is often seen as a critical milestone in AI development, where a project moves from testing feasibility to real-world implementation and growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Concretely, this doesn&#8217;t say much about what should be done&#8230; But I tried to understand how to take advantage of the latest &#8220;using Prompt Engineering&#8221; feature of MLflow.</p>\n<p>Why that because, this MLflow&#8217;s feature allows you to track LLM responses across different settings of model temperature, max output tokens and of course prompts. This allows for transparent prompt engineering and parameter tuning&#8230; And above all you can also leverage on self-hosted LLMs on Ollama!</p>\n<p>Mostly, I use Ollama to operate open-source LLMs to have extensive control over the confidentiality of the content sent to the LLMs and to reduce drastically the expenses.</p>\n<p>I also ended up finding a video and plenty of documentation from Mlflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/djliden/llmops-examples/blob/main/mlflow-compare-llms.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> A very educational notebook that fully describes the process of &#8220;Comparing LLMs with MLFlow&#8221;.</a> Like it is said by the author &#8220;This notebook demonstrates how to use MLFlow to compare different text generation models from Hugging Face and compare different generation configurations for those models.&#8221;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRv8fmlvZ1w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MLflow: serving LLMs and prompt engineering</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/guides/step1-create-deployments.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MLflow’s Support for LLMs</a>.

      "rendered": "<p>I wonder if I did not make an error of judgment&#8230;<br />\nAs my objective remains to build a system likely to promote AI&#8217;s adoption, it pushed me to favor Streamlit as Frontend instead of building a real web application with a framework like Vue.js.</p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files, mostly prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_build_vue_js_on_fastapi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_build_vue_js_on_fastapi</a></b></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Streamlit web application is victim of its own success and stakeholders started to ask me for modifications on the frontend. As if it was much more a web application than an exploratory tool!</p>\n<p>I am trapped, my main mission is not to flesh out a web application but more to implement IA features through an API. So, devoting time to the web application is to take the risk to get lost in the weeds!</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I did a quick assessment of how long it would take to replace Streamlit with Vue.js and connect it to the IA api built with Fastapi. This discovery is what this post is about.</p>\n<p>First, here is the User story behind the scenes: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\n# prompt for this User Story<br />\nUser Story: As a PO I want to build a web application propelled with Vue.js and not on Streamlit, aka the frontend to query an API built in Python with FastAPI aka the backend. The API delivered IA features. </p></blockquote>\n<p><b>This wish meets several objectives:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delegate the creation and maintenance of the web application to another team in order to relieve the AI team from frontend management. So, the AI&#8217;s team can focus on tasks with added value for AI e.g. fine-tuning, selecting models, etc.</li>\n<li>Pool knowledge internally so you are not isolating yourself in Python to make apps that you create and maintain elsewhere with other technologies. </li>\n<li>Re-enter into the digital device&#8217;s classic production cycle with all the stages that this implies: UX, Testing, CI&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this post, I have defined a simple architecture for the application. The API instead of CRUD operations may handle IA functionalities but for educational purpose, I have simplified the objective, so the API consists of two main parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Backend (FastAPI):</b><br />\nIt provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and serves as the backend server for the application. </li>\n<li><b>Frontend (Vue.js): </b><br />\nIt is a single-page application (SPA) built using Vue.js to interact with the backend APIs and render the user interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tech stack could be the following: </p>\n<pre>\r\n# Backend\r\nFastAPI\r\nSQLAlchemy & SQLite\r\nPydantic\r\nJWT (JSON Web Tokens)\r\n# Frontend\r\nVue.js\r\nVuex\r\nVuetify\r\nAxios\r\n</pre>\n<p><i>I made some prompts to help me out. See vite_vue_prompt_4.md, vite_vue_prompt_5.md</i></p>\n<h2>GitHub Projects as Exploration Milestones</h2>\n<p>As always, I searched the length and breadth of GitHub looking for projects containing a backend (FastAPI) and a frontend (Vue.js). Many projects are on Docker</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A very inspiring project where I have grabbed my User Story. <a href=\"https://github.com/krassykirov/FastAPI-Vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/krassykirov/FastAPI-Vue</a></li>\n<li>The most complete step-by-step walkthrough to achieve a SPA (Single Page App) with FastAPI and Vue.js. <a href=\"https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-fastapi-and-vuejs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-fastapi-and-vuejs/</a></li>\n<li>A good knowledge refresher even if even the API is not made in Fastapi: &#8220;Fetching Data from a Third-party API with Vue.js and Axios.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/fetching-data-third-party-api-vue-axios/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sitepoint.com/fetching-data-third-party-api-vue-axios/</a></li>\n<li>A quick and dirty, very straightforward &#8220;Serve Vue from Fastapi in a breeze&#8221;. <a href=\"https://dimmaski.com/serve-vue-fastapi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dimmaski.com/serve-vue-fastapi/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two projects are much closer to my conditions of use.

It&#8217;s true that I spend time reading philosophy. It ends &#8220;affecting&#8221; or &#8220;infecting&#8221; my life&#8217;s overall comprehension! So, below, here are some thoughts. </p>\n<p><b>For those who are already bored, you can skip this part and move on to part &#8220;1. Collecting SEO Prompts&#8221;.</b></p>\n<p><b>For this post also, you can find all files, mostly prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_prompt_seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_prompt_seo</a></b></p>\n<p>I should warn you like on serious post &#8220;Any opinions, findings, and conclusion or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the view of the &#8230; etc&#8221;</p>\n<p>By the way, &#8220;Sign o&#8217;the Times&#8221;, a new disclaimer is born. It exists now an essential document on &#8220;Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. See <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/ai/ai_policy_guidance.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.copyright.gov/ai/ai_policy_guidance.pdf</a>. Intriguing text talking on what is human and what is not, so what can be protected by copyright or not.</p>\n<h2>1. &#8220;AI m&#8217;a tuer&#8221; or how AI killed me</h2>\n<p>Like anyone, I have the impression that the emergence of AI demonetized knowledge and experience. It is even more true in the digital industry: Development, Design, SMO, SEO, ASO, Consulting, Testing, Marketing, Q/A&#8230; The list seems endless! </p>\n<p>In terms of organization, AI digs the tomb for the power&#8217;s exercise, knowledge within companies. Politically, nations are also enlisted for this change. Indeed, from verticality, we go for horizontality! It is the symbolic collapse of time and individuals. In the coming years, the present time will partly drive by IA.</p>\n<p>In company for instance, with the irruption of AI, strategy thinking shifts to direct application. This shift can be summarized by this Emiliano Zapata like slogan principle: &#8220;The strategy belongs to those who apply it&#8221;&#8230; And I should add with the help of IA. For sure, sooner or later, sole AI will be in charge.</p>\n<p>While waiting for the AI&#8217;s triumph, if you are in a position of power, in &#8220;seniority&#8221; I should say: either you resist with the risk of disappearing, or you support the change to survive! Like always, the truth stands probably in between: to support the change while maintaining your privileges.</p>\n<p>In summary, in these glorious AI&#8217;s time, it is not easy to know which ethics to adopt regarding work. For the record, nowadays, most people talk about AI but do they realize that this discourse is the germ of an unprecedented historical mutation where human rationality and therefore decisions cease to be at the center of the individual.</p>\n<p> Does working in AI consist mostly keyword stuffing? My own personal record was recently broken because in less than 3 minutes I heard the words: Best Of Breed, All-in-one, Ideation, Innovation, Exploration, POV (Proof Of Value), POC (Proof of Concept)&#8230; Not bad, huh?</p>\n<p><i>On consulting and keyword stuffing, check out w9_prompts_consulting.md and w10_prompts_consulting.md in _prompts on <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_prompt_seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_prompt_seo</a></i></p>\n<p>No wonder in work as in many aspects of life, imposter syndrome becomes prevalent. Although AI offers a new lease of life to many sectors, AI thereby infantilizes all individuals and knowledges. So, with the IA, Jane Doe and John Doe aren&#8217;t really working &#8211; they just shamming. Anyway, IA is a selling product and working on IA make you, a tiny linchpin of the latest transformation driven by markets. There is a pseudo non-conformism to work on IA. I read a definitive conclusion about this.</p>\n<blockquote><p>De tous les conformismes, le conformisme du non-conformisme est le plus hypocrite et le plus répandu aujourd&#8217;hui. Vladimir Jankélévitch</p>\n<p>Of all conformisms, the conformism of non-conformism is the most hypocritical and the most widespread today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, I enjoy using IA and at some point you must still land on something concrete. So, let&#8217;s deconstruct with the help of AI some knowledges on SEO and ASO. Remember that you can find all the code and the prompts behind this post.</p>\n<h3>1. Collecting SEO Prompts</h3>\n<p>I decided to go with an API as I want to industrialize my best SEO practices for any kind of content that I produce. I also use my personal blog as an API as I cannot give access to the API I am working with professionally.</p>\n<p>In very rational way, for the SEO issue, I try to answer to these simple questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Data:</b> What data do I have?

Yep, plenty of professional has worked on this issue. A quick fishing on GitHub have given me plenty of examples. </li>\n<li><b>Code:</b> Is there any logic available through code on GitHub for instance regarding this issue? I did not find so much files as most of the professional are making the praise of their services and SaaS e.g. semrush.com</li>\n</ol>\n<p><H3><b>1.

Methodology</h2>\n<p>First, as I intend to release around the D-DAY, I got Ike in mind. Second, this decision-making matrix still sticks around in my head a bit.

Without paying attention, the pay-as-you-go pricing system can quickly become &#8220;poisonous&#8221; as the more you outsource tasks to IA, the more you pay.</p>\n<p>For the last week, I have decided to go with ChatGPT and Mistral API key, so I was forced to scrutinize the pricing pages for input and output according to the models.

Rapidly, I made a search on explanations about the ChatGPT and Mistral pricing because I am lazy. I found good ressources, especially this post: &#8220;Reduce Your OpenAI API Costs by 70%&#8221; at <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/reduce-your-openai-api-costs-by-70-a9f123ce55a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/reduce-your-openai-api-costs-by-70-a9f123ce55a6</a></p>\n<p><b>This post introduces a fruitful correlation between cost efficiency and prompt design patterns!</b></p>\n<h2>Some tips on Cost efficiency &#038; Prompt Design Patterns</h2>\n<p><b>Here are notions quickly summarized that I kept from this post. The very first thing that you need to know is that, when you connect with an LLM via an API key, you are billed when sending content to the LLM (input) and when receiving content from the LLM (output). </b></p>\n<p><i>1. Number of tokens for a prompt</i></p>\n<p>For input, even though you&#8217;re sending a very short prompt, there  will be additional tokens sent within the prompt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Notice that prompt_tokens, which refers to the input tokens, is 8. This is because every time you send text to the API, an additional 7 tokens are automatically added. </p></blockquote>\n<p>A good tool for ChatGPT, to count tokens number, it is to use this tool which calculates the tokens number from a text: <a href=\"https://www.tokencounter.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tokencounter.io/</a></p>\n<p><b>For LLM, the key element the Token so what you need to know is &#8220;what a token is?&#8221; which is the basic element that will be &#8220;input&#8221; and &#8220;output&#8221; by the LLM. </b></p>\n<p><b>For example, for an English text, 1 token corresponds to approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. For reference, Shakespeare&#8217;s collected works are approximately 900,000 words or 1.2 million tokens. </b></p>\n<pre>\r\n# some examples\r\n\r\n1 token ~= 4 chars in English\r\n1 token ~= ¾ words\r\n100 tokens ~= 75 words\r\n\r\n1-2 sentence(s) ~= 30 tokens\r\n1 paragraph ~= 100 tokens\r\n1,500 words ~= 2048 tokens\r\n2,000 words ~= 2730 tokens\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Simple Token definition</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer</a></p>\n<p><i>2. Number of tokens for completion</i><br />\nYou will pay also what is produced by the LLM in the form of tokens.</p>\n<blockquote><p> The value is what we expected, representing the tokens in the response generated by the model.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>See 001_reduce_api_costs.py, 002_reduce_api_costs.py, 003_reduce_api_costs.py at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs</a></b></p>\n<p><i>3. Clustering using OpenAI API</i></p>\n<p><b>Clustering, a great idea that must be explored if you intend to leverage on an LLM API KEY.</b></p>\n<p>Here a quick definition of the user need.</p>\n<blockquote><p> Imagine you have a huge list of news headlines and you want to cluster them. While using embeddings is one option, let’s say you want to use OpenAI language models API, as it can capture meaning in a human-like way. Before we create the prompt template to minimize costs, let’s look at what our news headlines list looks like. I&#8217;ve represented the news headlines in a shorter form, like s0, s1, s2, and so on. The reason for this is that when the language model clusters them, it can simply use these short abbreviations (e.g., s35 for the 35th news headline) instead of writing out the entire headline in each cluster. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Here is also a simple explanation of the expectation.</p>\n<blockquote><p> Next, I defined my prompt template. This template specifies the format of the answer I want the language model to provide, along with some additional information for clarity. The key here is that we’re not asking the model to write out the full headlines, but rather to just use the short abbreviations. All we need to do is pass this prompt template to the function we created earlier and see how it performs in terms of pricing and response quality.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>See 003_reduce_api_costs.py at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs</a></b></p>\n<p><i>4. SpellCheck using OpenAI API</i><br />\nPrompts enable you to do anything from summarize a text to code a script so why do not use LLM to correct spelling mistakes. The only drawback, the experience has been made in English only, I am not sure that the performances in correcting spelling mistakes are equivalent in any language.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let’s say you have a lengthy text document and you want to build a grammar correction tool as a small web app. While there are many NLP techniques available for this task, language models, particularly those from OpenAI, have been trained on vast amounts of data, making them a potentially better choice. Again, the key is to be strategic with our prompt template. We want the API response to highlight incorrect words and suggest their correct spellings, rather than providing the entire corrected text as output.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>See 005_reduce_api_costs.py, 006_reduce_api_costs.py at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_pricing_llm/reduce_api_costs</a></b></p>\n<h2>Exploring the pricing of the NVIDIA platform</h2>\n<p>There is also an uncomplicated way to explore different types of LLMs, a bit like huggingface.co, which is to rely on the NVIDIA platform which provides a turnkey package of LLMs and a handful of credits for start your tests.

This pilot phase makes it possible to extend the validation phase to a larger sample of content and uses. This integration will be done via Feature flipping (the AI feature is only available to a limited number of users). This makes it possible to test/validate by having usage feedback on potential problems (performance, connectivity, refine usage based on production content, etc.). This is a Fine-tuning phase. </li>\n<li>Phase_4: Put into production, opening of the feature to all users in the business tool e.g. Backoffice. The feature nevertheless continues to evolve because of improvement of the existing model or by changing the model. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As soon as the integration is done in a business tool, phase_3 must be carried out identically.</p>\n<p><H2>More infos</H2></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce Your OpenAI API Costs by 70% | by Fareed Khan | Mar, 2024 | Level Up Coding<br /><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/reduce-your-openai-api-costs-by-70-a9f123ce55a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/reduce-your-openai-api-costs-by-70-a9f123ce55a6</a></li>\n<li>Pricing ChatGPT<br /><a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://openai.com/api/pricing</a></li>\n<li>Technologie | Mistral AI | Frontier AI in your hands<br /><a href=\"https://mistral.ai/fr/technology/#models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mistral.ai/fr/technology/#models</a></li>\n<li>GitHub &#8211;

      "rendered": "<p>What to do once you identify the possible usages offered by AI? As a Product Owner, the risk is sometimes to pay lip service once again by describing needs but never really satisfying them!</p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files, mostly prompts, on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages_code_depot/tree/main/prompts/prompts_webapp_api_fmm_ia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages_code_depot/tree/main/prompts/prompts_webapp_api_fmm_ia</a></b></p>\n<p>Other elements e.g extract in French from the readme of the project. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_building_llm_api_web_apps_start_finish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_building_llm_api_web_apps_start_finish</a></b></p>\n<p>There is a French expression that summarize this fate is &#8220;se payer de mots&#8221; that could be translated by &#8220;to indulge in words&#8221;. You just talk, you never act. That is probably the meaning behind this Laozi&#8217;s quote that shaped Chinese wisdom </p>\n<blockquote><p>He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know. Laozi</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>So, I decide to move my a&#8230; then how to proceed?</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, what is the better way than using AI to understand and make AI</li>\n<li>Second, the real added value resides in the prompts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>For the moment, I decide not to release the code as I do not know the status of it regarding my professional situation but anyway with the help of the prompts it is like having an open book. So, You will find in the repository the list of 50 prompts that it took me to code a “Webapp + API + LLM” device from scratch.</b></p>\n<p><b>The Advanced LLM AI App relies on these elements:  Mistral is used as LLM, LangChain and Ollama as framework to query the LLM, FastAPI as framework to create the API and Streamlit as framework to create the web application.</b></p>\n<p><b>The challenge was being able to query Mistral as a LMM in a secure, confidential and for free while waiting to implement or not a paid API key for Mistral or ChatGPT.</b></p>\n<p>Again, some chineese wisdom, like Confucius said: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. Confucius</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of give a fish (coding), I teach you how to fish (prompting) 🙂</p>\n<p>For more security concern, I don&#8217;t give the code as I risk putting myself at odds with my employer. On the other hand, I constantly need to refer to this knowledge base so what&#8217;s better than keeping the prompts and share it with myself and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p><b>At the end this post, I gave some screens captures from the final result.</b></p>\n<h2>Workplan</h2>\n<p>So, humbly and within my means, I therefore allowed myself to build a system to tackle the subject of AI in order to demystify its uses and its technicality.</p>\n<p>As demonstrated by the previous posts, you must already be able to simply state the objective pursued based on what you already know and what you are trying to do.</p>\n<p><b>Objective: The idea is to facilitate the AI&#8217;s exploration uses via user interfaces in order to obtain user feedback on the level of quality and acceptance of this or that AI functionality. : transcription, entity extraction, translation, summary&#8230;</b></p>\n<p>It requires creating interfaces that the user can grab as quickly as possible. It means removing all obstacles upstream, in order to connect these screens to artificial intelligence as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>After some research, the idea that emerged was to set up, as quickly as possible, a complete system including the following building blocks: <b>LLM + API + WEBAPP</b>.</p>\n<p><b>This is the meaning of this graph below and which I introduce into the equation in point 1.</b></p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/workflow_webapp_api_llm_4_small.png\" alt=\"Transform Your Ideas into Reality: Develop an Advanced LLM AI App with Mistral and ChatGPT's Expert Guidance and Comprehensive Prompts\" title=\"Transform Your Ideas into Reality: Develop an Advanced LLM AI App with Mistral and ChatGPT's Expert Guidance and Comprehensive Prompts\"></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s amazing is that with the sole help of AI, designing, coding&#8230; so prototyping everything took about an intense week but only one week where it would have probably taken 6 months or even more.</p>\n<h2>1.

And then? Introducing the usages</h2>\n<p>What functionalities should be included in this architecture and how to possibly go beyond basic uses and of course always rely on the fundamentals according to the DRY principle</p>\n<p><b>I ask ChatGPT and it gave me a quick roadmap. ChatGPT gave me a quick reminder on the best pratices to stick to avoid pitfalls, you can check below the regular stuff to do!</b></p>\n<p>In this architecture, the functionalities to consider can revolve around enhancing user experience, optimizing performance, extending data analysis and processing capabilities, as well as ensuring security. Here are some suggestions for each element of the architecture and how to go beyond basic usage while adhering to the DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself) principle:</p>\n<h3>LLM:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Improvement of accuracy and reliability:</b> Integrate advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction quality.</li>\n<li><b>Customization:</b> Allow model customization to adapt to specific user needs.</li>\n<li><b>Interoperability:</b> Ensure seamless integration with other systems and external services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>API:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scalability:</b> Design the API to effectively handle growing workloads.</li>\n<li><b>Comprehensive documentation:</b> Provide detailed API documentation to facilitate its use by third-party developers.</li>\n<li><b>Versioning:</b> Implement an API versioning system to allow evolution while maintaining backward compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WEBAPP:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>User-friendly interface:</b> Design an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface to enhance user experience.</li>\n<li><b>Performance optimization:</b> Optimize queries and loading times to ensure maximum responsiveness of the application.</li>\n<li><b>Real-time analysis:</b> Integrate real-time analysis features to enable users to visualize and understand data more quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Going beyond basic usage while adhering to the DRY principle:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Modularity:</b> Design each element of the architecture in a modular way to promote code reuse and easy maintenance.</li>\n<li><b>Use of microservices:</b> Decompose functionalities into independent microservices to enable scalable development and efficient scaling.</li>\n<li><b>Automation:</b> Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate development, testing, and deployment processes.</li>\n<li><b>Monitoring and logging:</b> Integrate monitoring and logging tools to track system performance, detect errors, and proactively improve code quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these principles and integrating these functionalities, the architecture can be extended beyond basic usage while remaining compliant with the DRY principle, enabling the development of a robust, scalable, and easily maintainable system.</p>\n<p><b>So with these principles, I stuffed my architecture with my use cases which mechanically drew a roadmap.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>POC_1: A simple way to explore and interact with IA features through an API (Fastapi) connected to a WEBAPP (Streamlit).</li>\n<li>POC_2:  Some explorations on Chatbot Building with 2 main objectives : 1. Ask a local LMM (Mistral) via a ChatBot, therefore free and confidentially via Ollama. Of course, the system must be transposed to a paid model (ChatGPT, Mistral) and in the cloud (Azure); 2. Explore the notion of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Functionally, this means building a knowledge base from heterogeneous content (.txt, .doc, docx, .pdf&#8230; etc.) then relying on a LLM like Mistral in order to query this knowledge base through a WEBAPP (Streamlit) that provided a ChatBot.\n</li>\n<li>POC_3: Turninng all these POC into a reliable docker-compose that support a backend (API made with FastAPI) and frontend (a WEBAPP made with Streamlit)\n</ul>\n<p>For me, the highest step was obviously the addition of an LMM in this device in order to be able to prompt in a confidential and secure manner. In case of failure, I will have opted for Buy instead of Build.</p>\n<h2>2. The RAG pack (POC_2)</h2>\n<p>Just a few words on the POC_2, on the RAG. I had never heard of this thing but incidentally, once the basic architecture is set up, you can easily launch grapples towards other uses such as Rag for example.</p>\n<p><b>For those, who do not know what is a RAG?</b><br />\nHere is the most straightforward explanations that I found on the web and that mostly focus on user benefices.</p>\n<p>The source is this post<br />\n&#8220;Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): From Theory to LangChain Implementation&#8221;: <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the concept to provide LLMs with additional information from an external knowledge source. This allows them to generate more accurate and contextual answers while reducing hallucinations.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>In simple terms, RAG is to LLMs what an open-book exam is to humans. In an open-book exam, students are allowed to bring reference materials, such as textbooks or notes, which they can use to look up relevant information to answer a question. The idea behind an open-book exam is that the test focuses on the students’ reasoning skills rather than their ability to memorize specific information.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>On the RAG, you can find various prompts and code at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages_code_depot/tree/main/prompts/prompts_serie_conversational_chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages_code_depot/tree/main/prompts/prompts_serie_conversational_chat</a></b></p>\n<h2>3. A small extra : using FLOWISEAI</h2>\n<p>During, this exploration, I have discovered FLOWISEAI and great videos from @leonvanzyl.<br />\nFLOWISEAI is a very intuitive software that should be used for many uses such as RAG for instance. It is UX-oriented and user-centric to enable anyone to get to crip with IA concepts such as Prompt, Rag, Chatbot&#8230; FLOWISEAI is as great as Streamlit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@leonvanzyl/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/@leonvanzyl/videos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.restack.io/store/flowise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.restack.io/store/flowise</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://flowiseai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://flowiseai.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>HOW TO INSTALL FLOWISEAI</b></p>\n<pre>\r\n# go to dir\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/ia_using_flowiseai/\r\n\r\n# create dir\r\nmkdir flowiseai\r\n\r\n# go to the dir flowiseai\r\ncd flowiseai\r\n\r\n# install flowise\r\nnpm install flowise\r\n\r\n# install flowise globally\r\nnpm install -g flowise\r\nnpm uninstall -g flowise\r\n\r\n# start flowise\r\nnpx flowise start\r\n\r\n# check the site\r\nhttp://localhost:3000/\r\n\r\n# Other documentation\r\n# https://www.langchain.com/\r\n</pre>\n<h2>4.

      "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s not easy to document a process in progress, I am always late! Since what I am talking about has already become obsolete.</p>\n<p> <b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_llms_usecases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_llms_usecases</a></b></p>\n<p>Indeed, even though with the help of ChatGPT, I am in the process of making a prototype for an IA combination: &#8220;WebApp + API + LLM&#8221; to meet the AI needs that I have identified such as transcription, translation, generation using prompt and a bunch of various NLP tasks: Summary, NER, even Spelling Correction which has nothing to do with IA!</p>\n<p>This Prototype&#8217;s project I have already mentioned in small touches throughout the last posts on this blog and as evidenced by the GitHub directory: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages</a></p>\n<p>In this post, I will present two classic cases: News Topic Classification and Sentiment Analysis. As is often the case when we act, we find ourselves confronted with the reality of what needs to be done and the idea we have of it. What are the takeaways from these two POCs applying IA on Data.</p>\n<h2>What I learn from this experience?</h2>\n<p>I had already made such experiments but this time, somehow, I needed to present results and drew some conclusion. So, here they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In a data-centric approach, data is key (dataset). The dataset goes through three stages: Bronze, Silver, Gold.</li>\n<li>80% of the work focuses on Evaluation Strategy, 20% Model Implementation</li>\n<li>The Data-centric approach can be summarized like so :<br />\n        <code>AI = Model + Data</code> where you mostly focus on data.\n    </li>\n<li><b>DATA IS A FUEL, as an input as an output</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is quite peculiar because you can choose a model without breaking a sweat especially for classical issues such as News Topic Classification, Sentiment Analysis but you are going to bust your ass gathering the data and structuring it! In an almost caricatured manner, the workload is often distributed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>80% of the work is to consolidate the data and making change management. </li>\n<li>The resting 20% of the work is choosing Model and developing a combination <code>Webapp + API + LLM</code>. By the way, development that can be made by ChatGPT, Mistral, Codelama, llama2&#8230;. Choose your weapon. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Methodology: Some other concerns and few valuable lessons (MLOps).</h2>\n<p><b>There are also two major concerns to deal with: Confidentiality, Free.</b></p>\n<p>In News Topic Classification issue, USECASE_2, the fact of having replaced Mistral with ChatGPT, this was therefore done free of charge and securely.</p>\n<p>Finally, we followed what we call an ML-OPS process. Process which is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n1. Ideation<br />\n2. Framing<br />\n3. Data Collection<br />\n4. Data Preparation<br />\n5. Feature Engineering<br />\n6. Modelling<br />\n7. Deployment<br />\n8. Change<br />\n9. Run\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Here an illustration of the MLOps.</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"\n    src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mlops-loop-en_small.png\"\n    alt=\"The Al Spectrum: Unveiling Layers of Intelligent Systems\"\n    title=\"The Al Spectrum: Unveiling Layers of Intelligent Systems\"><br />\nSource: <a href=\"https://ml-ops.org/content/mlops-principles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ml-ops.org/content/mlops-principles</a></p>\n<p><b>MLOps has much in common with Design Thinking Process</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"333\"\n        src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Five-steps-of-the-ideation-process_small.png\"\n        alt=\"Design Thinking Process\"\n        title=\"Design Thinking Process\"></p>\n<h2>Build a release, a must-have.</h2>\n<p>After, this framing and thinking, let do the acting. The time-to-market require to release a product as quick as possible by the end of few sprints even for a POC. Thanks to the LLM such as Mistral of ChatGTP, writing a rough combination rough for a &#8220;WebApp + API + LLM&#8221; is becoming more and more a piece of cake.</p>\n<p><b>You can check the directory &#8220;fastapi_usecase_1_sentiment_analysis&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_llms_usecases/fastapi_usecase_1_sentiment_analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_llms_usecases/fastapi_usecase_1_sentiment_analysis</a></p>\n<p>With a series of ten or twenty prompts, you can jot a serious candidate. I beat recently my personal record with 50 prompts for a &#8220;WebApp + API + LLM&#8221; combination. The only reason why the number prompts inflates is that the number API’s endpoints was higher and that induced an increase complexity for the Streamlit or Vite.js UX Webapp.</p>\n<h2>Find Dataset</h2>\n<p>Due to some confidentiality, I have substituted my datasets by some sample grabbed on Kaggle. Anyway, the principles are the same and the code is strictly identical.</p>\n<p>I found one by searching &#8220;News Topic Classification&#8221; and &#8220;Sentiment Analysis&#8221; on Kaggle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>News Topic Classification: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/ag-news-topic-classification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/ag-news-topic-classification</a></li>\n<li>Sentiment Analysis: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/input\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/input</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s dig the usecases</h2>\n<p>The first case is called <b>usecase_1_sentiment_analysis</b>, a very classical one. You got text, most of the time comments and you want to classify if the text is negative or positive. </p>\n<p>My only issue was that the text was in French but for educational, i have swap the model and give now an English sample and a model trained on English. The French Model is still in the code, commented, is based on &#8220;distilcamembert-base-sentiment&#8221; found on <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment</a></p>\n<p>The English model is <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/lxyuan/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased-sentiments-student\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://huggingface.co/lxyuan/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased-sentiments-student</a></p>\n<p><b>I have also drastically reduced the sample to 1000 rows for the Sentiment Analysis because it works easily on my Mac.</b></p>\n<p>See the sample at <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/input\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/input</a></p>\n<p>The second case is more sophisticated than the first one: <b>usecase_2_text_classification</b>. It is an issue on text classification e.g. Posts made on Social Networks have to re-categorized. I have made 2 user stories on this issue that I have turned to prompts sent to Mistral.</p>\n<p><b>What is amazing is that with LMM is that as far you have created an API that is able to query with a prompt a LLM such as Mistral then you are good to go to implement whatever user story you want! See below, two prompts slightly different but the mechanic remains the same.</b></p>\n<pre>\r\n     V1 choice in a limited number of predefined categories\r\n    # first_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\r\n    #     \"Act as a highly intelligent news chatbot and classify the given news text into one of the following categories only: France, Europe Africa, America, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Sports, Economy, Technology, Culture, Environment.

      "rendered": "<p>I changed the nature of my personal sprint objective, moving away slightly from AI concerns to reconnect with more general considerations about Data and its processing: from collection to its visualization through its &#8220;processing&#8221;. Ultimately, of course, this treatment could be injected with AI or ML. As always, when we start thinking about such a vast subject, the first question is what do we want to land on to define the scope? In this case, I wondered how to approach the question of data.</p>\n<p>So, according to me and after compiling several resources, finally the two things that seem most important to me for now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I improve visualisation of existing data e.g csv for instance?</li>\n<li>What are the ways to improve data collection?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account.

Quite provocative and indeed, sensible for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agile without leadership is worthless, it amounts to submitting to stupid and pointless formalism 🙂</li>\n<li>Agile 2 is also a clever way to sell even more, it&#8217;s a bit like Persil laundry detergent, a new formula.

I was about to make a complete benchmark among the market solutions: Superset, Redash and even ClickHouse.

Superset with Docker</h2>\n<p>Superset is the most intuitive tool that I found to improve visualisation. Here is a quick way to install and manage Superset with Docker.</p>\n<pre>\r\n# go to path\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/how_to_use_superset/\r\n\r\n\r\n# command to open docker\r\nopen -a docker\r\n\r\n# clone the dir\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git superset\r\n\r\n\r\n# get into the dir\r\ncd superset\r\n\r\n\r\n# get the superset stuff \r\ndocker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml pull\r\n\r\n# start the superset stuff \r\ndocker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up\r\n\r\n# start using Superset\r\n# http://localhost:8088\r\n# username: admin\r\n# password: admin\r\n</pre>\n<h2>2. Connecting Superset to Databases</h2>\n<p>You need to have some databases e.g. <code>mariadb</code>, <code>mongodb</code>, <code>mysql</code>, <code>postgresql</code> installed on your machine to leverage on a database. To be sure to connect Superset to your local database, you need to use the hostname <code>docker.for.mac.host.internal</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>.</p>\n<p>On mac, the best way to do so: install databases, it is to use homebrew. Here are the commands  to install databases.</p>\n<pre>\r\n\r\n# list services for database\r\nbrew services list\r\n\r\n\r\n# classical commands before install\r\nbrew update\r\nbrew upgrade\r\nbrew doctor\r\n</pre>\n<p>To Install Homebrew if you haven&#8217;t already: https://brew.sh/</p>\n<pre>\r\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/main/install.sh)\"\r\n\r\n# Update the Homebrew formulae:\r\nbrew update\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>2.1 MARIADB</b><br />\nMariaDB is an open-source, community-developed relational database<br />\nmanagement system (RDBMS) that serves as a drop-in replacement for MySQL.<br />\nIt offers a robust and flexible SQL engine with features such as stored<br />\nprocedures, views, subqueries, and triggers. </p>\n<p><b>Advantages of MariaDB:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Compatibility:</b> MariaDB is highly compatible with MySQL, making it easy<br />\nto migrate existing databases without having to rewrite code or modify<br />\napplications.</li>\n<li><b>Performance:</b> MariaDB offers improved performance compared to MySQL<br />\nthrough enhancements like optimistic optimization and asynchronous<br />\nreplication.

Collecting data: Using kafka, a corner stone</H2><br />\nApache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. In the context of an analytics application, Kafka plays a crucial role in handling the flow of data between different components of the application. It provides a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-throughput messaging system that allows seamless communication between various modules of the analytics application.</p>\n<p>Here are some key purposes of Kafka within an analytics application:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Data Ingestion</b>: Kafka acts as a central hub for ingesting data from various sources such as databases, logs, sensors, and other systems. It enables the application to handle large volumes of incoming data in a scalable and efficient manner.</li>\n<li><b>Event Streaming</b>: Kafka allows the streaming of events in real-time. This is beneficial for analytics applications that require continuous processing of data, enabling real-time insights and analytics.</li>\n<li><b>Decoupling of Components</b>: Kafka helps in decoupling different components of the analytics application. Producers can publish data to Kafka topics without worrying about who will consume it, and consumers can subscribe to the topics they are interested in.</li>\n<li><b>Fault Tolerance and Durability</b>: Kafka ensures fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes. This makes it a reliable and durable solution, ensuring that data is not lost in case of failures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://kafka.apache.org/</a></i></p>\n<p><b>We are going to take the most straightforward way on mac, meaning using homebrew like we did previously for database. The commands will almost the same as we will use Homebrew.</b></p>\n<p>Again, if you need to install homebrew, type in the console, the following command.</p>\n<pre>\r\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>To install kafka with Homebrew</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nbrew install kafka\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>To list the services from Homebrew</b></p>\n<pre>\r\nbrew services list\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>If you&#8217;ve installed Kafka and Zookeeper using Homebrew on your macOS system, you can use the following commands to interact with Kafka and gain an understanding of its general principles.</b></p>\n<p><b>1. Start Zookeeper:</b><br />\nZookeeper is a prerequisite for Kafka, and it manages distributed configurations and synchronization between nodes. Open a terminal and start Zookeeper:</p>\n<pre>\r\nbrew services start zookeeper\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>2. Start Kafka Server:</b></p>\n<p>Now, start the Kafka server using Homebrew:</p>\n<pre>\r\nbrew services start kafka\r\n</pre>\n<p>This command will start the Kafka server as a background service.</p>\n<p><b>3. Create a Topic:</b></p>\n<p>Kafka organizes data into topics. Create a Kafka topic to publish and subscribe messages:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-topics --create --topic brunotopic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\r\n</pre>\n<p>Replace `brunotopic1` with the desired topic name.</p>\n<p><b>4. List Topics:</b></p>\n<p>List the existing Kafka topics:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>5. Produce Messages:</b></p>\n<p>Produce some messages to the topic:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-console-producer --topic brunotopic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\r\n</pre>\n<p>This command opens a console where you can type messages. Press `Ctrl + D` to exit.</p>\n<p><b>6. Consume Messages:</b></p>\n<p>Open a new terminal and consume messages from the topic:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-console-consumer --topic brunotopic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning\r\n</pre>\n<p>This command subscribes to the topic and prints incoming messages.</p>\n<p><b>7. Describe a Topic:</b></p>\n<p>Describe the properties of a Kafka topic:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-topics --describe --topic brunotopic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>8. Kafka Commands Documentation:</b></p>\n<p>Explore additional Kafka commands and options by checking the official documentation:</p>\n<pre>\r\nkafka-topics --help\r\nkafka-console-producer --help\r\nkafka-console-consumer --help\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>9. Stop Kafka:</b></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re done, you can stop the Kafka server:</p>\n<pre>\r\nbrew services stop kafka\r\nbrew services stop zookeeper\r\n</pre>\n<p>This will stop the Kafka server running as a background service.</p>\n<p>These commands provide a basic overview of Kafka&#8217;s functionalities. You can experiment further and refer to the [official documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for more in-depth understanding and configuration options.</p>\n<p><b>Using faststream</b></p>\n<p>To go further, you can leverage on <b>FastStream</b>. A kind of <b>FastAPI</b> for Kafka. Indeed, FastStream simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for message queues, handling all the parsing, networking and documentation generation automatically.</p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/faststream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://faststream.airt.ai/latest/faststream/</a></i></p>\n<p><H2>More infos</H2><br />\n<H3>Superset</H3></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welcome | Superset<br /><a href=\"https://superset.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://superset.apache.org/</a></li>\n<li>Apache Superset Tutorial · Start Data Engineering<br /><a href=\"https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/apache-superset-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/apache-superset-tutorial/</a></li>\n<li>Introduction | Superset<br /><a href=\"https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro/</a></li>\n<li>Setting up Superset GitHub Integration: 3 Easy Methods<br /><a href=\"https://hevodata.com/learn/superset-github/#l12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hevodata.com/learn/superset-github/#l12</a></li>\n<li>Course Bytes &#8211; YouTube<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@coursebytes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/@coursebytes</a></li>\n<li>Preset Cloud &#8211; Modern Open Source BI Platform | Preset<br /><a href=\"https://preset.io/product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://preset.io/product/</a></li>\n<li>Get started with Apache Superset and PostgreSQL®<br /><a href=\"https://aiven.io/blog/get-started-with-apache-superset-and-postgresql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://aiven.io/blog/get-started-with-apache-superset-and-postgresql</a></li>\n<li>Tutorial &#8211; Creating your first dashboard — Apache Superset  documentation<br /><a href=\"https://apache-superset.readthedocs.io/en/0.28.1/tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://apache-superset.readthedocs.io/en/0.28.1/tutorial.html</a></li>\n<li>Introduction à Apache Superset &#8211; datacorner par Benoit Cayla<br /><a href=\"https://datacorner.fr/introduction-a-apache-superset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://datacorner.fr/introduction-a-apache-superset/</a></li>\n<li>Documentation Superset — Restack<br /><a href=\"https://www.restack.io/docs/superset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.restack.io/docs/superset</a></li>\n<li>GitHub &#8211; apache/superset: Apache Superset is a Data Visualization and Data Exploration Platform<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/superset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/apache/superset</a></li>\n<li>Apache Superset Tutorial | Censius Blog<br /><a href=\"https://censius.ai/blogs/apache-superset-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://censius.ai/blogs/apache-superset-tutorial</a></li>\n<li>Fully managed Redash — Restack<br /><a href=\"https://www.restack.io/store/redash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.restack.io/store/redash</a></li>\n<li>Apache Superset Overview Video &#8211; YouTube<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGfUIOK87V8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGfUIOK87V8</a></li>\n<li>Redash vs Superset: Which data visualization tool should you select? &#8211; YouTube<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33wA0gW01M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33wA0gW01M</a></li>\n<li>Comment utiliser l’IA pour l’analyse des données ?

The PAPE is still in still in WIP. But, at the same time, I found plenty of tools launched almost each week. These tools reshape constantly the world of AI daily at a breakneck pace and in unprecedented proportions that makes the very phenomenon difficult to follow. Here is a concise list of my last investigation!</p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account.

Their motto is &#8220;Anyone can code&#8221; like a kind of geek version of the &#8220;Anyone can cook&#8221; from Gusteau in Ratatouille.</p>\n<p>Basically, you can have two usage&#8217;s strategies towards open-interpreter:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can harness ChatGPT to run code on your computer to complete some tedious tasks for example: massive file renaming,<br />\n  extract content from a bunch of pdfs and make a summary&#8230;etc One for all, every task that you have already delegate to ChatGPT exception made that it is now taking control of your computer! <b>CAUTION: it requires a ChatGPT paid license and it will increase your monthly bill! We don&#8217;t get anything for nothing</b></li>\n<li>If you are thrifty and patient, with the help of interpreter combined with LM Studio, you can even take advantages of local LLMs such as Mistral, Orca, Codellama, Llama2&#8230; Every LLM available on huggingface.co. <b>It does no cost anything, it is more secure but is slow!</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can have a look at the official website: <a href=\"https://openinterpreter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://openinterpreter.com/</a> or check the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are using Anaconda, you can create a specific environment e.g &#8220;open_interpreter&#8221; or use the default one aka &#8220;base&#8221;. Up to you.</p>\n<p><b>Both in base or in a specific environment, it requires a paid API Key from ChatGPT e.g <code>sk-XXX-jkhjkhjkhjkh-FAKE-jkhjhXXX454423FCFG-FAKE-jk</code></b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open_interpreter_base_env_anaconda_small.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open_interpreter_base_env_anaconda_small.png\" alt=\"Using open-interpreter\" width=\"800\" height=\"520\"></p>\n<pre>\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n  [env]\r\n  # Conda Environment\r\n  conda create --name open_interpreter python=3.9.13\r\n  conda info --envs\r\n  source activate open_interpreter\r\n  conda deactivate\r\n  \r\n  # if needed to remove\r\n  conda env remove -n [NAME_OF_THE_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT]\r\n  conda env remove -n open_interpreter\r\n  \r\n  # update conda\r\n  conda update -n base -c defaults conda\r\n  \r\n  # to export requirements\r\n  pip freeze > requirements.txt\r\n  \r\n  # to install\r\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n  \r\n  # [path]\r\n  \r\n  cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/ia_and_the_fake_prompt_academy\r\n  python 001_open_interpreter.py\r\n  \r\n  See https://docs.openinterpreter.com/setup#python-usage\r\n  \r\n  - Installation\r\n  pip install open-interpreter\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  - Console or Terminal usage\r\n  interpreter\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \"\"\"\r\n</pre>\n<p><H2>Commands to use interpreter</H2></p>\n<p>Below are the three possible ways to take advantage of open interpreter.

      "rendered": "<p>Exploring Hugging Face, finding LLMs and packaging the LLMs into a &#8220;quick and dirty&#8221; API with FastAPI was my last sprint goal. It just ended on Monday this week.</p>\n<p><i>Again the title was made with AI, check the word &#8220;Harnessing</i></p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_using_other_llm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_using_other_llm</a></b></p>\n<p>Indeed, newly appointed AI coordinator, I am working to structure my work as I would on any project.</p>\n<p>I am now starting the second Sprint with a hybrid objective:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to find a way to locally test other LLMs in a more confidential and secure way than on &#8220;classical&#8221; websites such as ChatGPT (<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://chat.openai.com/</a>) or the Microsoft&#8217;s copilot (<a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://copilot.microsoft.com</a>). Especially, if I start to work with more personal data. </li>\n<li>I had to prepare training documents for teenagers on the discovery of the Python language, but the emergence of generative AI completely demonetizes reading a book on programming or even attending training. </li>\n<p><i>By the way, you can find a set of resources from Books, Exercises, Notebooks to discover and learn Python. It exists both in French and in English on my GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/learning_python_for_all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/learning_python_for_all</a></i></p>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Consequently, it seemed much more opportunistic to me to provide a Jupyter Notebook or a Google Collab. Indeed, the learner can learn and practice at the same time. Even better, coupled with a tool like Ollama or Lmstudio, the learner can obtain the information via prompts to complete his/her instruction. So, it&#8217;s two birds with one stone, learning Python self-guided by the art of the prompt.</b></p>\n<p><i>I made a french version only for kids: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/learning_python_for_all/blob/main/003_code_for_family_lesson/001_notebook_python_code_for_family_lessons.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/learning_python_for_all/blob/main/003_code_for_family_lesson/001_notebook_python_code_for_family_lessons.ipynb</a></i></p>\n<p>Without even mentioning the fact that the provision of different LMMs makes it possible to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compare the performance of each of them.</li>\n<li>To practice the art of prompting either personally or professionally using more &#8220;sensitive&#8221; data such as statistical data, generating real Jira tickets if you are a PO or producing Cypress Code for UAT testing if you are QA, produce python code if you are a devlopper&#8230; etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But, in addition to the immediate and unconstrained use of LLMs, a question remains: should we rejoice in these facilities offered by AI? All of this, at the same time, totally devalues work and therefore will inevitably “kill” an astronomical number of jobs. The hunt, like the question, remains open.</p>\n<h2>Loading LLM with ollama.ai or lmstudio.ai</h2>\n<p>I found 2 great tools to query LLMs confidentially and securely. The only remark the only remark that this calls for is that lmstudio is much more UX friendly than ollama.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://ollama.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ollama.ai/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://lmstudio.ai/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Baseline for lmstudio.ai</b><br />\nIt says what it does&#8230;</p>\n<pre>\r\nWith LM Studio, you can ...\r\n&#x1f916; - Run LLMs on your laptop, entirely offline\r\n&#x1f47e; - Use models through the in-app Chat UI or an OpenAI compatible local server\r\n&#x1f4c2; - Download any compatible model files from HuggingFace &#x1f917; repositories\r\n&#x1f52d; - Discover new & noteworthy LLMs in the app's home page\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Using ollama commands</b></p>\n<p>You can find other info at <a href=\"https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama</a></p>\n<pre>\r\n# COMMANDS\r\n\r\n# To run and chat with Llama 2\r\nollama run llama2\r\nollama run orca-mini\r\nollama run mistral:text\r\nollama run falcon:7b\r\n\r\n\r\n# To run and chat with orca-mini\r\nollama pull llama2\r\nollama pull orca-mini\r\n\r\n# remove a model\r\nollama rm llama2\r\nollama rm orca-mini\r\nollama rm mistral\r\nollama rm falcon:7b\r\nollama rm mistral:text\r\n\r\n\r\n# list the model\r\nollama list\r\n\r\n\r\n# when you are in the model you can use\r\n>>> /?\r\n>>> /list\r\n>>> /set verbose\r\n\r\n# to get out from the model\r\n/exit\r\n\r\n# create a custom prompt\r\n# you need to create a file for your model named \"hotwater\". It look like a file\r\nollama create hotwater - ./hotwater\r\n\r\n# ollama create [modelFileName] - ./[modelFileName]\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br />\n<b>With such tools, you can load any LLM at no cost, then you have unlimited access to LLMs, a great sandbox for experimentation and a pretty good Privacy. You join the band wagon of the IA revolution for better and for worse. As you may discover that your job has changed or even worse does not exist anymore. So, you can consider retraining and start a new career of &#8220;Amazon-Book-Faker&#8221;, using IA to write fake books on any subject 🙂 2024 will be the Post-Anything (Truth, Work, Books, Training&#8230;) Era or will not be.</b></p>\n<h2>Videos to tackle this post</h2>\n<p>Video #1 Using LLM in Ollama or LM Studio: Discover LLMs potential (orca-mini) help through Ollama for daily tasks in a safe and confidential way.<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjpj41yrgro\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

      "rendered": "<p>I have already mentioned many times on this blog the obstacles linked to managing a multilingual digital product. Indeed, whether you are creating a mobile application, a site or even a CMS, multilingualism increases the complexity somewhat. For AI, inevitably, the question arises with even more strength. For instance, whatever the language is, how is possible to ensure the same quality for functionalities in NLP (NER, Keywords extraction, summarization, etc.) or for audio extraction&#8230; etc. and so, what is the best strategy to adopt to overcome this obstacle?</p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_translation_gradio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_translation_gradio</a></b></p>\n<p><b>Looking for the miracle translation tool to tackle the subject of multilingualism. The post was of course also an opportunity to discover the inexhaustible resources of the HuggingFace site as well as the possibility of using Gradio to dress up my AI productions as Streamlit does. </b></p>\n<p><i>A little clarification on languages, I am really looking for an LLM able to translate a wide variety of languages. I need to get rid of my Eurocentrism and include in my quest a fair number of different languages such as African languages: Hausa, Kiswahili, Mandenkan, Fulfulde, Wolof and of course Asian languages such as Chinese, Khmer or Vietnamese, Slavic languages such as Russian, Ukrainian and of course Persian, Arabic or finally Romanian. In short, a real babelian sample!</i></p>\n<p>As such, Meta became aware of the under-representation of African linguistic groups for its &#8220;no-language-left-behind&#8221; library. As such, Meta is therefore launching a call to document certain African languages. So if you speak the Congo, Kinyarwanda or Swazi languages, join the band wagon.</p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/request-for-proposals/translation-support-for-african-languages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ai.meta.com/research/request-for-proposals/translation-support-for-african-languages/</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ai.meta.com/blog/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation/</a></i></p>\n<h2>Few words on Masked Language Modeling</h2>\n<p>An interesting essay on Masked Language Modeling so here is a definition taken from the Keras site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Masked Language Modeling is a fill-in-the-blank task, where a model uses the context words surrounding a mask token to try to predict what the masked word should be.</p>\n<p>For an input that contains one or more mask tokens, the model will generate the most likely substitution for each.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Input: &#8220;I have watched this [MASK] and it was awesome.&#8221;<br />\nOutput: &#8220;I have watched this movie and it was awesome.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like any beginner in IA, during the few tests on Masked Language Modeling with Roberta, I have experimented stranger things! Sometimes, the result is a bit little confusing. Especially, once again when the &#8220;system&#8221; has to guess a word in a context that is more &#8220;African&#8221; than &#8220;American&#8221; I should say! Without being a specialist on the issue, I use this example as an illustration of cognitive bias, which is also very much linked to cultural domination.</p>\n<p>Indeed, for sure, Roberta guesses the capital of Oregon but misses that of Uganda due to lack of appropriate training.</p>\n<pre>\r\n[MASK] is the capital of Oregon.\r\n# For sure, everybody knows that the correct answer is \"Portland\" and the probability to have \"Portland\" as a proposition is close to one!\r\n# Portland 94%\r\n# This 2%\r\n# Washington 1%\r\n# Seattle 1%\r\n# It 0%\r\n</pre>\n<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gradio_Masked_Language_Modeling_oregon_800x204.png\" class=\"img-featured img-responsive wp-post-image\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p>\n<pre>\r\n[MASK] is the capital and largest city of Uganda.\r\n# For sure, everybody knows that the correct answer is \"Kampala\" and the probability to have \"Kampala\" as a proposition is not even in the propositions!\r\n\r\n# Juba 25% Juba is the capital and largest city of South Sudan. \r\n# Uganda 14%\r\n# Beni 8% A city in the Democratic Republic of Congo\r\n# Nairobi 6% Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya.\r\n# It 6%\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gradio_Masked_Language_Modeling_uganda_800x204.png\" class=\"img-featured img-responsive wp-post-image\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></p>\n<p>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_translation_gradio/004_pyyush_maskedlanguagemodeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_translation_gradio/004_pyyush_maskedlanguagemodeling</a></p>\n<p><i>Source:<br />\n<a href=\"https://keras.io/examples/nlp/masked_language_modeling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://keras.io/examples/nlp/masked_language_modeling/</a></i></p>\n<h2>Cut the NLP &#038; Multilingualism&#8217;s Knot</h2>\n<p><b>One of the main impediments I wanted to solve is boiled down to this question: How to offer the same NLP features in an API in an unlimited number of languages? </b></p>\n<p>Until now, in fact, the English language predominates in AI, so the models are trained in this language. Two solutions are therefore available to us:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Waiting for the situation to improve and therefore having an open source LLM including your missing languages. Time is then your enemy and it is risky but as we have seen, the NLLB initiative may solved the issue. </li>\n<li>Choose a &#8220;pivot&#8221; language such as English or French, Spanish. Then, the process wil be the following: translate the content, apply the selected AI models (NER, Keywords extraction, summarization, etc.) that you want to the newly translated text in English, then retranslate the result! Smarter and more pragmatic solution, at least it is all in your hands! </li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>To translate text from one language to another for translation in 200 languages with PyTorch and Hugging Face transformers, I will be using Facebook&#8217;s NLLB 200 3.3B</b></p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B</a></i></p>\n<p><b>Below, a quick presentation for each GitHub directory for this overall exploration of translation IA mechanism.

Not to mention the phenomenon of the disappearance of languages that will reduce their number and therefore the complexity of this translation issue! The end will come quickly maybe the translation capabilities addressing all languages will be avalable in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. There will remain the thorny and much more costly question of customisation training corpus to work on translation this time but in a specific context. I will call it culture in some way. Just remember Uganda versus Oregon showed earlier.</p>\n<p><H2>More infos</H2></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Masked Language Modeling<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/pyyush/MLM\" target=\"_blank\"

      "rendered": "<p>This last post is again a journal to me of an how-to. This time, the post is dedicated on how to deploy in the Cloud a Machine Learning&#8217;s features API, built with FastAPI. For the cloud, I have chosen Azure as I will probably work with it. Indeed, the deployment in the Cloud is the last step to close my Machine Learning&#8217;s API creation process investigation. Previously, I explored roughly all the required steps from ML (Machine Learning) customization to development with FastAPI, through the discovery of specific packages like Whisper, Spacy for instance.</p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_deploy_api_ml_architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ia_deploy_api_ml_architecture</a></b></p>\n<p>For such exploration, I know the drill by now! Based on some stakeholders needs, I came to the unsurprising conclusion that the target will be an API, developed in Python with FastAPI, hosted in the Azure Cloud, exposing value-added AI &#8220;features&#8221; based on different models such as  the ones provided by Spacy or Whisper for various contents type such as Audio, Text, Image&#8230; overcoming as much as possible the multilingual issue for non-English languages.</p>\n<p>In these last months, I just more or less consciously combine a Design Thinking Process with DevOps Lifecycle. All that remains now is to iterate on this workflow to refine the API creation segments.</p>\n<p>In a near future, I will shed some light over the overall methodology that has inspired me, this natural combination between Design Thinking Process &#038; DevOps Lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>1. Methodology reminder: Involuntarily mixing Design Thinking Process &#038; DevOps Lifecycle</h2>\n<p><b>I did not intend to do so but involuntarily I have taken a mix of the two methods. At least, their keywords/values have been my compass during this first part of a journey through IA!<br />\nJust as reminder for myself, for each method, here are both the basic and an acronym forged like a mantra to remember these keywords/core values.</b></p>\n<h3>1.1 Design Thinking Process</h3>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Design thinking should bring your ideas to life by putting users at the center of every process.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Acronym: E.D.I.P.T</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Empathize</b> – Understanding people</li>\n<li><b>Define</b> – Figuring out the problem</li>\n<li><b>Ideate</b> – Generating your ideas</li>\n<li><b>Prototype</b> – Creation and experimentation</li>\n<li><b>Test</b> – Refining the product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.2 DevOps Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>DevOps is a software development methodology that combines software development (Dev) with information technology operations (Ops), blending these two worlds in the entire service lifecycle: from the initial product design, through the whole development process, and to production support.</p>\n<p><b>Acronym: P.C.B.T.P.R.O.M</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Planning:</b> task management, schedules.</li>\n<li><b>Coding:</b> code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.</li>\n<li><b>Building:</b> continuous integration tools, version control tools, build status.</li>\n<li><b>Testing:</b> continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks, performance measurement.</li>\n<li><b>Packaging:</b> artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.</li>\n<li><b>Releasing:</b> change management, release approvals, release automation.</li>\n<li><b>Operating:</b> infrastructure installation, configuration and management, infrastructure changes (scalability), infrastructure as code tools, capacity planning, capacity &#038; resource management, security check, service deployment, high availability (HA), data recovery, log/backup management, database management.</li>\n<li><b>Monitoring:</b> service performance monitoring, log monitoring, applications performance monitoring, end-user experience, incident management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Experiments to prepare deployment of POC, made with FastAPI, on Azure</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get down to practice without further delay. On many subjects and particularly on artificial intelligence, far too many people pay lip service.</p>\n<p><b>Here is the code produced through the different experiments that I made to understand deploy on Azure for a webapp.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>advanced_docker_compose_fastapi: several example using docker-compose and Makefile.</li>\n<li>api_fastapi_routes: routing issue and different solutions provided with the help of ChatGPT</li>\n<li>fastapi-simple-app: simple app to deploy</li>\n<li>fastapi_cheatsheet: cheat sheet for fastapi for documentation especially. </li>\n<li>fastapi_tiangolo_advanced_settings: advanced setting examples. </li>\n<li>mamamia-fastapi-azure: application, written with the help of ChatGPT, made with FastAPI deployed to the Azure Cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Requirement: Using docker is a requirement to deploy on Azure</h2>\n<p>Well, you will quickly discover that the must-have to deploy on Azure is to use Docker.<br />\n<b>Docker enable you to create en development environment for your app and then deploy it to Azure. Moreover, Docker makes it easy to get started and enables easier switching between projects, operating systems, and machines.</b></p>\n<p>According to me, here are the two pitfalls that I learn from Docker usage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clean often Images and Containers: Docker takes huge amount of space disk on your local disk as you are going to create images, containers and so on. So, you must learn quickly how to undo. Undo means to clean up your local disk and get rid of the images and containers.</li>\n<li>Leverage on docker-compose.yaml &#038; Makefile: Docker require a to know/learn a bunch of commands and concepts that will slow down your learning curb. <b>The best idea to optimize this task is by adding to your project a docker-compose.yaml and Makefile to manage the Docker for FastAPI.

How-to: Deploying a containerized FastAPI app to Azure Container Apps</h2>\n<p>Below here is the best post that I have found made by Pamela Fox, Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. I am truly focusing only on the step by step to deploy a very simple fastapi on Azure services.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/03/deploying-containerized-fastapi-app-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/03/deploying-containerized-fastapi-app-to.html</a></p>\n<p>I have described each step as much detail as possible because I have an annoying tendency to forget steps or to not remember commands. I also hate typing these very commands. It is the reason I added so many Makefiles or scripts to all the projects. Let do the computers do the work for me. This is the great benefit of IT, namely automation, even if sometimes it is as said Peter Drucker &#8220;There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p><H3>4.1.

      "rendered": "<p>To a certain point, exploring AI usages has become like playing the game Happy Families :). Indeed, since august 2023, I have tackled some AI&#8217;s applied usages: Deploying NLP features, Annotation &#038; Machine Learning Model Customization, Exploring ChatGPT Prompts, Delegating to ChatGPT Time-Consuming Product Owner Tasks&#8230; I must admit that the ultimate objective is to gather a decisional matrix that will give both a usage/solution combinations list, each tempered by pros and cons and a &#8220;big picture&#8221; of the IA ecosystem.</p>\n<p><b>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper</a></b></p>\n<h2>Exploring the Audio revolution with Whisper</h2>\n<p><b>This time, in the AI use family, I am taking the audio family. This post is therefore an opportunity for a quick POC exploring Audio and AI with the main objective to extract transcription from an audio file then expose it via an API. Like always, the API is designed with FastAPI, this part remains from one post to one another remarkably similar! </b></p>\n<p>This post idea was inspired by the recent announcement of the collaboration between Spotify and OpenAI which announces the possibility of listening to your favorite podcasts in your native language! </p>\n<p>Some prominent podcasts available in English are available into German, Spanish and French with &#8220;Voice Cloning&#8221; which is quite impressive. The announcement is unambiguous: &#8220;Spotify&#8217;s AI Voice Translation Pilot Means Your Favorite Podcasters Might Be Heard in Your Native Language&#8221;. So, you can hear podcasters like Dax Shepard, Monica Padman, Lex Fridman, Bill Simmons, and Steven Bartlett and their guests with generated AI-powered voice translations in other languages—including Spanish, French, and German.</p>\n<p>I have checked out these two podcasts to figure out. Well, it is very professional, astonishing, and extremely useful for a better understanding, mostly performative and a bit without cultural roots. It reminds me this quote of Wittgenstein: &#8220;The limits of my language are the limits of my world&#8221;. Precisely expressing the sensation, I got is far beyond the purpose of this post, so I keep it for myself!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Traducido con IA] Yuval Noah Harari: Naturaleza humana, Inteligencia, Poder y Conspiraciones &#8211; Lex Fridman Podcast<br />\n[Traducido con IA &#8211; Español] | Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6S3TPytV81NWmkDArApKYl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://open.spotify.com/episode/6S3TPytV81NWmkDArApKYl</a></li>\n<li>The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett  [Traducido con IA &#8211; Español] | Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7oOabGYIDTpIENhYPNUFdP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://open.spotify.com/show/7oOabGYIDTpIENhYPNUFdP</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ChatGPT to the rescue to get definitions</h2>\n<p>Right now, I am more a &#8220;Doer&#8221; than a &#8220;Thinker&#8221;. So, on a more basic level, I ask ChatGPT to precise how do you call these operations, here is the prompt. That clarify a bit the battle ground.</p>\n<p><b>Prompt_1</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you call Text-to-Speech Conversion, from text you create an audio with a robotic voice and how do ou call Text-to-Speech Conversion where the voice of the user has been cloned ?</p></blockquote>\n<p><i>You can check &#8220;chat_GPT_3_5_prompt_5&#8221; in the file &#8220;prompts_chatgpt_samples.diff&#8221;. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper</a></i></p>\n<p><b>This first prompt helps me also to schematically determine the several stages for a machine learning model pipeline that I have converted to a second prompt!</b></p>\n<p><b>Prompt_2</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>Can you describe into different stages the process of audio cloning to produce a podcast like the one from Lex Fridman with Yuval Noah Harari that have been translated to Spanish. Number the steps and give them a summary title each time with a description for each stage e.g stage_1 :: Audio Transcription, stage_2 :: Transcription Translation&#8230; and so on </p></blockquote>\n<p><i>You can check &#8220;chat_GPT_3_5_prompt_11&#8221; in the file &#8220;prompts_chatgpt_samples.diff&#8221;. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/ai_openai_whisper</a></i></p>\n<p><b>Well anyway, this time I did not use the answer from ChatGPT as I found this answer not enough synthetic and too much analytic! Ungrateful Human 🙂 I have also forged a portmanteau word that is not a standard industry terminology &#8220;Cloned Voice Overing&#8221; so ChatGPT will not understand.</b></p>\n<p>So, here is my rough Process Map in four main steps or stages.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>stage_1: Audio Transcription</b><br />\n<i>Description: This is the text extraction from the audio. This is also the main focus of this post. You can even think of doing at this stage some NLP transformation.</i></li>\n<li><b>stage_2: Transcription Translation</b><br />\n<i>Description: The transcription is translated into a chosen language. Damn it, here you have to select a good translation tool.</i></li>\n<li><b>stage_3: Voice Cloning</b><br />\n<i>The voices heard in the audio from the host e.g Lex Fridman and the guests e.g., Yuval Noah Harari are trained and reproduced or cheaper you can go robotic voices for both, what a fraud then! Ditto, like the stage_2, finding a great tool is key.</i></li>\n<li><b>stage_4: Cloned Voice Overing</b><br />\n<i>The podcast is produced with the cloned or synthesized voices that are used for voice-over narration preserving also all the inputs from the first production (sound effects, jingle&#8230;).</i></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Like I said, for the moment I am modestly focus on stage_1.</b></p>\n<p>Last thing to say! Even though I claim to only be interested in the how-to. I ask a few questions about the purpose of all this. This experience raises many questions without being a conspiracy theorist. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the measure of the Spotify&#8217;s experiment. It is also a major advance and a brilliant instrument for soft power and cultural domination. Naively, I often tend to forget that technology, content, and ideology are linked. It is always healthy to ask the question of the political and economic purpose behind the &#8220;so natural&#8221; adoption of AI.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/09/26/spotify-launches-ai-tool-for-translating-podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/09/26/spotify-launches-ai-tool-for-translating-podcasts</a></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-25/ai-voice-translation-pilot-lex-fridman-dax-shepard-steven-bartlett/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-25/ai-voice-translation-pilot-lex-fridman-dax-shepard-steven-bartlett/</a></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/whisper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://openai.com/research/whisper</a></p>\n<h2>POC with Whisper and attempt with FastAPI</h2>\n<p><b>It is mainly a POC so you have progressive and iterated attempts that goes from the simple usage to the integration into FastAPI.

Good, for a journalist or for anyone working with audio, it is interesting to easily perform such operations: get quickly full transcription of an interview to rework, to translate, to retrieve keywords, make a summary&#8230; etc</p>\n<p>For example, the site Slator point out 6 Practical Use Cases for the New Whisper API. Well, I am really interested in these 2.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<b>Indexing Podcasts and Audio Content</b><br />\nWith the rise of podcasts and audio content, the Whisper model can be used to transcribe and generate text-based versions of audio content. This can help improve accessibility for those with hearing impairments and also improve &#8220;search-ability&#8221; for podcast episodes, making them more discoverable.</p>\n<p><b>Transcription Services</b><br />\nTranscription service providers can use OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API to transcribe audio and video content in multiple languages accurately and efficiently. The API’s ability to transcribe the audio in near real-time and support multiple file formats allows for greater flexibility and faster turnaround times.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: Here Are Six Practical Use Cases for the New Whisper API. <a href=\"https://slator.com/six-practical-use-cases-for-new-whisper-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://slator.com/six-practical-use-cases-for-new-whisper-api/</a></p>\n<p><i>This trend was already predicted 3 years ago&#8230; by Deloitte.

For the NER function \"entities\" used \"body: RecordsRequest = Body(..., example=example_request)\" where,\r\nexample_request is provided by an external json file named example_request.json.\r\n\r\nPlease define the appropriate json structure according to the code for the API.\r\n\r\nThe API rely on a sqlite database named \"nlp_post_db.db\". It has to be structure like a traditional FastAPI project, the\r\nORM used is sqlalchemy. Below the wanted structure:\r\n\r\nnlp_db_app\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n├── crud.py\r\n├── database.py\r\n├── main.py\r\n├── models.py\r\n└── schemas.py\r\n\r\nIn the file \"models.py\", the class Post(Base) contains fields like: post_id, post_title, post_body, post_origin_id,\r\nkeywords_ner. The API is saving the result of the NER function \"entities\" available at \"/entities/{lang}\".\r\n\r\npost_id is the primary_key for each post.\r\npost_title is the title of the post.\r\npost_body is the body of the post.\r\npost_origin_id is the id coming from another database.\r\nkeywords_ner is the result of the NER function \"entities\" available at \"/entities/{lang}\"\r\n\r\nSo, when the post_body is passed to the function \"entities\", the result is saved the result into a table and especially.\r\nentities extracted from the post_body\r\n</pre>\n<p><H2>Why saving data from the API?</H2><br />\nVery basically, the results of the machine learning model can either produce an immediate result through an API call or for a future usage where the result is saved into a database e.g. extracting keywords, text summary&#8230; And another process is merging the data with some other data with database migration.</p>\n<p>Just as reminder, an ORM make querying a database with FastAPI easier whatever the database type is e.g. (mysql, sqlite&#8230;etc). It will make your code more readable, easier to maintain, scalable and often more performing 🙂 even if this last point can be discussed. </p>\n<p>Like said the FastAPI official website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nAn &#8220;ORM&#8221;: an &#8220;object-relational mapping&#8221; library. An ORM has tools to convert (&#8220;map&#8221;) between objects in code and database tables (&#8220;relations&#8221;).</p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Source : <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/</a></i></p>\n<p><H2>API Structure with a database</H2><br />\nThere is also some good advice, especially in application structure, given by FastAPI when you build up a API with an ORM likeSQLAlchemy ORM (part of SQLAlchemy, independent of framework) or Peewee (independent of framework).</p>\n<p><b> Example of API structure</b></p>\n<pre>\r\n\tsql_app\r\n    ├── __init__.py\r\n    ├── crud.py\r\n    ├── database.py\r\n    ├── main.py\r\n    ├── models.py\r\n    └── schemas.py\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b>It is frankly good to know that it is easy to integrate any kind of database into your API project with FastAPI. Nevertheless, the most valuable lesson from this POC is that you rely on the best practice in top position among the FastAPI best practices &#8220;1. Project Structure. Consistent &#038; predictable&#8221; where &#8220;the best structure is a structure that is consistent, straightforward, and has no surprises&#8221;!</p>\n<p><i>Source : <a href=\"https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices</a></i></p>\n<h2>Videos to tackle this post</h2>\n<p>#1 POC with #fastapi for an #nlp #api with #spacy #sqlalchemy #sqlite and&#8230;

      "rendered": "<p>Doing AI does not make sense if you cannot expose these &#8220;discoveries&#8221; for use in digital products. This is the primary reason for my strong interest in Streamlit, which allows you to quickly expose Machine Learning Models and play with them.</p>\n<p>But what to do when we must move from experimentation via POC to industrialization? The immediately obvious idea is to create an API. So, after a quick benchmark, when you are beginner in Python like me, you pick FastAPI. This is the most sensible choice considering the time spent and the learning curve.</p>\n<p>For this post, you can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/fastapi_nlp_model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/main/fastapi_nlp_model</a></p>\n<h2>Cons-Pros-mise</h2>\n<p>Even Though, I know there are hundreds of articles making &#8220;the pros &#038; the cons&#8221; for Frameworks starting with &#8220;Django vs Flask vs FastAPI&#8221;. This sole list below convinced me.</p>\n<p><b>This article presents a clear and above all reduced list of the main comparison points for Framework against each other: Django, Flask and FastAPI.</b></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"414\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cursor_y_fastapi_tutorial__an_introduction_to_using_fastapi___datacamp.png\"></p>\n<p><i>Source : <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-fastapi-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-fastapi-tutorial</a></i></p>\n<p>Well, tinkering few Machine Leaning Models is one thing, but deploying and using them via an API in other contexts is another. So, if creating an API remains my first objective with the aim of making these same ML available to &#8220;enrich&#8221; a CMS for example. I got the strange feeling that this API creation could turn into a nightmare at the expense of the work on AI itself. </p>\n<h2>&#8220;The API has its reasons that ML knows not&#8221;*.</h2>\n<p>Naturally, this impression reinforced my desire to use a framework like FastAPI. For what? Because choosing a framework means committing to the virtuous best development practices path, without even knowing it! All the points of vigilance in the creation of an API are provided to you turn-to-key: Performance, Security, Deployment, Testing and Quality, Documentation&#8230; I inevitably forget some! This will ensure the sustainability of your API which could be in the heart of your AI&#8217;s strategy with maintainability and scalability at its best. Who could ask for more!</p>\n<p><i>I mimicked this famous quote from Blaise Pascal: &#8220;Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ignore&#8221; (The heart has its reasons that reason knows not).

I gave an example, found on the web, with Streamlit just for the fun. </li>\n<li><b>Testing/Quality:</b> Also important but it&#8217;s premature for a small POC even if I have made few unit testing with Pytest just to see. For a real one, I will add probably testing with Postman/Newman or even Cypress. </li>\n</li>\n<p><b>Dockerization:</b> As PO, it exhausts my computer all these images 🙂 But, I must admit Docker has numerous advantages to deploy a local turn-to-key environment and a API found on GitHub for instance. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- ml_fastapi_front_schema.png --></p>\n<p><b>A very basic workflow with the FastAPI&#8217;s API future place</b><br />\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ml_fastapi_front_schema_small.png\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"A very basic workflow with the FastAPI's API future place\" fetchpriority=\"high\"  data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ml_fastapi_front_schema_small.png\" alt=\"A very basic workflow with the FastAPI's API future place\"></p>\n<h2>Last word</h2>\n<p>Another semantic precision, I am easily mistaken, maybe because I use indifferently algorithm, machine learning, models for the same thing.

The project was initially using Poetry, I have used Anaconda, but I gave the poetry file configuration, and I just took the FastAPI API file. A must seen as the video has its purpose is to go through a super quick ML app build &#038; deployment.

Like in any learning process, to become a &#8220;doer&#8221; requires an essential step: <b>selecting tools.</b></p>\n<p><b>This action often allows both to deepen understanding and practicing. At the same time, you should not hesitate to throw away a technology or a tool if it proves to be too time-consuming for a poor result!</b></p>\n<p>I have focus my attention on a very basic question: How to build a custom NER with the help of Spacy? This question leads me to a bigger one: In NLP, how to build a machine learning pipeline with Label Studio or Docanno (open source), instead of Prodigy (paid)?</p>\n<p>Choosing the right tool answered to the thorny question of ensuring data quality and might give some accuracy to your model! Otherwise, you may fall in &#8220;Shit in, Shit out&#8221; curse. </p>\n<p> Like always, to ensure quality and accuracy, you must get down to the nitty-gritty. So, if you can, you must look under the hood and get our hands dirty with code.</p>\n<p><b>The importance of the Labeling process or annotating inside the ML pipeline.</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"850\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/A-common-pipeline-for-annotating-data-and-building-models-with-machine-learning.png\"></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-common-pipeline-for-annotating-data-and-building-models-with-machine-learning_fig1_359227212\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-common-pipeline-for-annotating-data-and-building-models-with-machine-learning_fig1_359227212</a></p>\n<p>So, for the sake of simplicity, the labeling process can be even cut into 6 steps</p>\n<ul>\n<li>step_1. Unlabeled data</li>\n<li>step_2. Labeler (loop)</li>\n<li>step_3. Labeled data</li>\n<li>step_4. Training (loop)</li>\n<li>step_5. Model</li>\n<li>step_6. Inference</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>&#8220;Simplest&#8221; Labeling Process with 6 Steps</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/labeling_process_small.png\"></p>\n<p><b>Here is a quick terminology to grasp roughly the essential of the Labeling process.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nData: interesting stuff to annotate &#8211; image, audio, video, text.</li>\n<li>Task: Single piece of data that is ready to be predicted or annotated ; Part of job ; Includes metadata relevant for predicting or annotating.</li>\n<li>Prediction: Inference output from a machine learning model</li>\n<li>Annotation: Human created or&#8230; approved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBnhpMLpBB0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBnhpMLpBB0</a></p>\n<p>Like as I said before discovering the labelling process, my original question was to create a specific NER with the help of Spacy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the ability to recognize name entities is paramount but most of the time you may need a specific NER because you are working with domain specific data e.g. Finance, Medicine, Cooking, History, Biology, African Football, Law, Cinema, Television, Transport&#8230; Anyway, there are many domains where you have to deal with specific words that which sounds like gibberish to laymen!</p>\n<h1>Methodology</h1>\n<p>I have to talk a little bit about methodology. First of all, use cases have always help me to enliven my learning process. So, I sure look after explanations but also select use cases, mostly quick and reproducible. Even if, use cases must be counterbalanced by the consciousness that mere imitation is not sufficient to fully understand AI/ML! Reproducing a tutorial will never turn you into a specialist. Thanks God, become a specialist is not my objective. As much as possible, I try to isolate real process like the labeling one to master IA cases and minimizing uncertainty when working on Projects in Real Life.</p>\n<h2>The Custom NER example</h2>\n<p>In the field of NLP, create a &#8220;custom NER&#8221; is a classic example. This is most often favored example. Indeed, it is the most intuitive process with the most striking results, a bit like writing your first test under Cypress on you website homepage, creating a blog in 20 min on RoR or finally building your WP plugin in 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>For any POC to have value, meaning instructive and profitable, two things are needed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set goals (OKR in particular)</li>\n<li>Set a time limit (Deadline) otherwise from POC you go to WIP which is as toxic as procrastination. In general, in duration, I try not to exceed a month and a half.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Always define objectives</h2>\n<p>So, here is a list of my objectives in term of learning value:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a custom NER for Spacy for specific vocabulary or specific language (African languages or poor documented languages e.g Hmong). This exploration leads to lead to discover NLP useful formats such as JSON, JSON-MIN, CONLL2003 to facilitate workflow.\n</li>\n<li>Discover a viable workflow on how-to customise a NER inside Spacy and find a free alternative to the tool https://prodi.gy/. This exploration leads to lead to annotation tool</li>\n<li>Eventually extend the annotation tool for other type of media e.g video, audio, images&#8230; This exploration leads to generate a customized ML model for YOLO image detection for instance. This case will be probably a topic for a next post.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Remember few LEAN AGILE principles and make some mix</h2>\n<p><b>Just as quick reminder, as I have read earlier some elements on Lean. I found interesting to mix also this investigation on my labeling process exploration with some rules from Lean methodology. All these principles are so many reminders when you get lost in explanations or in useless code creation.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go on site to see the problem: Go&#038;See or &#8220;Go to the Gemba&#8221;</li>\n<p>Gemba is the equivalent of the crime scene in Japanese.<b>Remain on the ground where you create and produce value. In business, Genba refers to the place where value is created;</b>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba</p>\n<li>The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle</li>\n<p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act avoids investing on false leads. Lean favors countermeasures that are ingenious, economical and whose effect can be verified quickly. I can resist to quote these &#8220;waste hole&#8221; examples as I definitely fell once in while in one of those traps.</p>\n<p><i>Type of waste: the 7 examples of waste</i></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Overproduction: Write code that is never used. Create a User Story sooner than necessary.\n</li>\n<li>Corrections &#038; retouching: Investigation and correction of a defect; Refactoring exactly opposite to that done by another pair.\n</li>\n<li>Waiting: Waiting for the availability of the test environment. Waiting for build result; Workstation slowness; Waiting for functional information or decision while performing a task.</li>\n<li>Inventory: Maintenance of a backlog of undeveloped User Stories; Regularly review the post-its on an &#8220;Ideas for improvement&#8221; poster without ever implementing these ideas.</li>\n<li>Useless gestures: Code navigation; Restarting the development environment (IDE).</li>\n<li>Unnecessary steps: Two pairs performing overlapping tasks.\n</li>\n<li>Transportation: Carry over changes between different branches within a configuration management system; Passing information from one developer to another.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the purpose is either to flesh out and make alive a real procedure, process or pipeline for annotating data and building models with machine learning for any kind of content.</p>\n<p>In most of the case, I have replaced Prodigy by Label Studio or even Doccano. I would rather go for Label Studio as it is compatible with DAGSHub.  Label Studio gave a great documentation and many examples for any kind of annotation process including sounds, images, videos&#8230;.</p>\n<h2>Set the environments with anaconda</h2>\n<pre>\r\n# list

      "rendered": "<p>After a careful reading of this report on the possible and probable future of journalism, it was time to build a roadmap of achievements regarding the concrete proposals formulated in the study.</p>\n<p><i>You can check the study &#8220;New powers, new responsibilities. A global survey of journalism and artificial intelligence&#8221;, by Charlie Beckett, Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a summary that I made in French is also available at:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/new_powers_new_responsibilities_the_journalism_ai_report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/new_powers_new_responsibilities_the_journalism_ai_report</a></i></p>\n<p><b>You can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/master/ai_chatgpt_prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/master/ai_chatgpt_prompts</a></b></p>\n<h2>1. Basic understanding on IA strategy: In-House or Outsourced: Which IA Solution is Best for Your Business? </h2>\n<p>Personally, I rarely deal with strategy. Rather, I define a specific actions plan coupled with objectives and I stick to it. Not hesitating to pivot or change direction when circumstances dictate. This is a personal interpretation of &#8220;Test early, Test often; Fail fast, Fail cheap.&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So, regarding IA, I have schematized in an overly simplistic way 2 IA applicable approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Tinkering:</b> To create an almost internal solution from scratch with some do it yourself with the help of open-source solutions and free ressources.</li>\n<li><b>Outsourcing:</b> To create a full external solution, leveraging on paid APIs available and with seasoned developers help. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Well, mostly, the truth stands in between these two scenarios according to the projects and objectives you want to achieve! </b></p>\n<p>Last thing, I hear a lot of people around me talking about AI strategy or IA trends, as if the AI&#8217;s emergence was going to happen in the future, a kind of dystopia. But it is here and now! As always, it often hides fear, lack of reflection, will postpone to later rather than a turn to action or strategic thinking. To me, a sophisticated way of procrastination, to lull oneself into comfortable and reassuring illusions. To paraphrase a quote from Jim Rohn about happiness, I will say that:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;IA is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sense, the AI&#8217;s phenomenon is certainly a technological advance but also a powerful indicator of everyone&#8217;s ability to reinvent themselves.</p>\n<p>Personally, actions carry values. Regarding AI, it only remains for me to go all the way again from reflection to design rather than wallowing into intellectual idleness.</p>\n<p><b>As a first conclusion, of course there are financial argument and that related to competence and training, but it is often the cultural resistance to change that is the main obstacle to AI&#8217;s adoption (Cf. Growth mindset vs Fixed Mindset).</b></p>\n<p><b>A precision, more political</b><br />\nNevertheless, I can add a small precision. Precision that goes far beyond the scope of this post. Far from any controversial will, in a sense, I can nevertheless accept this &#8220;cultural resistance&#8221; if it is backed by political beliefs. Indeed, this &#8220;IA&#8217;s fear&#8221; can be explained by the fact that everyone, professionally speaking, feels &#8220;condemned&#8221;, to be always more efficient like AI to respond to injunctions of modern capitalism: being both introspective and extrovert, being flexible and focused, being able to adapt and assert your uniqueness.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s get back to practice, exploring the uses of AI to implement functionalities in the context of my work within a media for example!</p>\n<p><!-- STUDY --></p>\n<h2>2. What I learn on IA strategy from this report on futur of journalism? </h2>\n<p>Even though the study may be from 2019, the IA&#8217;s needs for journalism expressed are more relevant than ever! I sought also for more concrete ideas, partly to distance from the hype around the term &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221;.</p>\n<p>First of all, a basic definition that suit for anybody:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Artificial intelligence is a collection of ideas, technologies, and techniques that relate to a computer system&#8217;s capacity to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Some of these points may sound obvious, but it is always good, for your own sake, to hammer some of these truths especially to defeat the &#8220;cultural gap&#8221; or the &#8220;cultural resistance&#8221; from editorial teams. </b></p>\n<p><b>The MVP&#8217;s approach applied to IA</b></p>\n<p>First lesson that sounds like a &#8220;cliché&#8221;, but like often, the best approach adopted seems to be the MVP [Minimum Viable Product] iteration when it comes to AI.</p>\n<p><b>A classical feedback loop approach, this means launching an early version of tools, getting feedback from its users, then rolling out new features and functionality, and then iterating on this feedback continuously. </b></p>\n<p>A second lesson taken from the report: remember that &#8220;Trying to do too much usually results in something that fails at everything&#8221;. So, picking up 2 or 3 IA significant topics that are related to your sector then make an MVP for each idea and reap the benefits of it seems again to be the best approach.</p>\n<p>Indeed mass, effective application of AI is new so most organisations will not be AI-ready. These organisations will have to build their knowledge, skills&#8230; and the designing 2 or 3 real projects remains the best opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>I have forged for myself this mantra :).</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Adoption by usage is the ferment of IA literacy. </b></p></blockquote>\n<p>Avoid as much as possible a formal and overarching IA strategy that does not fit to any reality. No a priori strategy, the feedback from the actions carried out during the project&#8217;s realization will shape naturally the strategy.</p>\n<p><b>In the report, many respondents reported confusion around roles and responsibilities.  Several respondents argued that at early-stage adoption for AI it is better to have a series of approaches related to different AI applications, rather than a formal, overarching strategy. </b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>(i) For IA, do not look for silver bullet solution</b><br />\nIt is all about digital transformation, AI will undoubtedly complete what is usually called &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; by &#8220;reshaping&#8221; this time not only the organization but the people who make up this organization. The transformation of the whole media industry has just really begun, and no-one has silver bullet on how to build and redefine organizational culture that can transform its core business and products to thrive in the new emerging AI-powered world. </li>\n<li><b>(ii) For IA, cultivate an open mindset to &#8220;grapple with changes. </b><br />\nSome of these media groups are familiar to challenges. The media industry has become used to grappling with change. AI is innately networked. It requires a skill set, knowledge base, defined roles, systematic appraisal, and a culture that relates the technologies to editorial or marketing. When fully integrated, pervasive, and operating at scale, AI could  have high value in certain areas such as audience engagement, story discovery, and labour efficiency. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Nice forecasts but what concrete ideas can be sought and applied? </b></p>\n<p>Well in a very pragmatic way, I have selected a shortlist of concepts and ideas that will build my &#8220;strategic roadmap&#8221;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Concept #1:</b> Among many of the best ideas that I have found in the report. I have selected the concept of <b>&#8220;augmented journalism&#8221;</b>. For me, it means to combine human editorial insights with AI. First, my unique aim will be to make this <b>&#8220;augmented journalism&#8221;</b> tangible. </li>\n<li><b>Project #1:</b> Explore the abilities given by ChatGPT to make journalists&#8217; work more efficient. (Outsourcing)</li>\n<li><b>Project #2:</b> Create an automatic tagging/entity extraction. This Named-entity recognition (NER) system in Natural language processing (NLP) should be extended to any text documents among the company from support mails to news. (Tinkering)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>For Project #2, I have made already several attempts available both on this Blog and on my GitHub account. Check the post &#8220;Extending Streamlit usage to create data science applications and other type of applications&#8221; at <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/2021/06/extending-streamlit-usage-to-create-data-science-applications-and-other-type-of-applications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://flaven.fr/2021/06/extending-streamlit-usage-to-create-data-science-applications-and-other-type-of-applications/</a></i></p>\n<p><b>So, in this post, I will focus more on Project #1:  Explore the abilities given by ChatGPT to make journalists&#8217; work more efficient. (Outsourcing)</b></p>\n<p><b>I have tried to use both Node and Python to explore ChatGPT API, but my preference goes to Python as it enables to implement many useful libraries such as Streamlit (UX), Spacy (NLP), Pandas and so on&#8230;. Choosing Python also gives also the opportunity to host Python apps on Azure to share them with users and give naturally a more homogeneous development environment &#8220;Python-centric&#8221;.</b></p>\n<h2>3. Alphabetization</h2>\n<p>Once for all, my purpose is always to provide users with seamless and powerful tools to work with. It is part of I have called &#8220;Alphabetization&#8221;. Alphabetization that brings proving tools according to usages instead of widening the cultural between IA and regular people who have just curiosity for it but no technical skills to explore.</p>\n<p><i>That what seasoned tech engineers does not always understand! It is also mainly the reason I am choosing Streamlit so make the AI usages are lively available to anyone. </i></p>\n<h2>4. Selecting use cases for ChatGPT Prompts</h2>\n<p>For Chat GPT, I have chosen the following examples and made it available through Streamlit with the help of Python Class.</p>\n<p>These multi purposes use case are both for Journalists (summary, tag extracting) or P.O (Product Owners) to explain code or ease Project Management.</p>\n<p><code><br />\n# cases 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 21, 22, 23, 39<br />\n3 :: Summarize for a 2nd grader<br />\n6 :: English to other languages<br />\n9 :: Parse unstructured data<br />\n10 :: Classification<br />\n11 :: Python to natural language<br />\n12 :: Movie to Emoji<br />\n17 :: Keywords<br />\n21 :: TL;DR summarization<br />\n22 :: Python bug fixer<br />\n23 :: Spreadsheet creator<br />\n39 :: Notes to summary<br />\n</code></p>\n<p><b>Most of the examples have been taken from the following source. It contains all the case studies available for Chat GPT.</b><br />\nSource: <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://platform.openai.com/examples</a></p>\n<h2>4. Implementing ChatGPT Prompts use cases into Streamlit  (project_3_streamlit)</h2>\n<p><b>You can find all files for each project on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/master/ai_chatgpt_prompts/project_3_streamlit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/ia_usages/tree/master/ai_chatgpt_prompts/project_3_streamlit</a></b></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most successful result in my opinion. Having selected a few use cases (see the list above), I wanted to be able to build a ChatGPT-Streamlit application that makes it easy to select and implement each of these ChatGPT examples.</p>\n<p><b>So, this app kill several birds with one stone! Check 010_project_3_python_streamlit_app_chatgpt_api.py</b></p>\n<p>This demonstrates through a POC the possible outsourcing strategy. The result must still doubtless be questioned. Indeed, basing its entire AI strategy on Chat GPT induces possible strategic threats in terms of independence and data security for any organization.</p>\n<p>But it is concrete proof that many routine, repetitive, even thankless tasks or tasks beyond the cognitive abilities of humans will obviously be delegated or entrusted, under human supervision and validation, to AI while freeing at the same time working time for journalists (Tasks vs. Jobs). Example: the summary, tagging and indexing of hundreds of thousands of photo, video, or text documents.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It explores concretely the abilities given by ChatGPT to make anyone&#8217; work more efficient so that illustrating the concept of &#8220;augmented journalism&#8221; or even &#8220;augmented PO&#8221;.</li>\n<li>In a breeze, the Python Class created to execute ChatGPT prompts enables to add some examples taken from ChatGPT, that&#8217;s a heck of a time saving. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>How-to manage the ChatGPT&#8217;s license (OPENAI_API_KEY) in Streamlit or Chainlit</b><br />\nThe very first requirement to build up an app was to know how to manage the ChatGPT&#8217;s license (OPENAI_API_KEY) in Streamlit.

This post is no exception. <b>Let&#8217;s give a quick insight on these different topics by making a shortlist. As often this post is an iterative construction on several simultaneous and offbeat ideas that have impacted my last three months.</b></p>\n<p><b>1. Future of Journalism vs IA:</b> Apparently, the company that employs me would like to modestly initiate reflection on the future of journalism with the eruption of AI. A kind of study that synthesize information more broadly on the impacts of AI on the practice of journalism.</p>\n<p>I found many resources but this one is great.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New powers, new responsibilities.

Discovering Google Trends</b><br />\nDuring a SEO mission, I gave me the opportunity to explore again Google Trends with a question in mind: What relevant editorial information can we draw from these statistics?</p>\n<p>The exploration of google trends reminded me at my expense of two fundamental rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trying to do too much usually results in something that fails at everything.</li>\n<li>Failing into formalism where you are thinking about concepts without embracing them by practice.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>To avoid the first pitfall? Well you need to constrain your attention and curiosity. For the second pitfall, in producing code, I take a MVP [Minimum Viable Product] start-up mindset. Essentially, this means launching a POC then iterating on it continuously&#8230; and I am using daily Chat GPT to process code to skip difficulties often encountered in programming.</b></p>\n<p><b>You can find all files on my GitHub account.

      "rendered": "<p>The experience, related in this post, was a challenge launched to me, born from both personal and professional factors:</p>\n<p><H2>1. From a personal point of view:</H2></p>\n<p>Following the writing of the book &#8220;Learning and Building E2E test automation with Cypress &#038; OKR&#8221; which expanded my understanding of the OKRs method and at the same time reinforced my Cypress testing framework&#8217;s understading and for like any one working in the digital industry&#8230; The ChatGPT-induced disruption to the landscape of my purring working routine!</p>\n<p><b>So, I decided to apply the method explained in the book with the help of ChatGPT under a harsh time constraint in order to measure ChatGPT&#8217;s gross help given. Intuitively, my feeling was that what has taken me months should only at least take weeks, solely in duo with AI.</b></p>\n<h2>Learning and Building E2E test automation with Cypress &#038; OKR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The book is available for sale on Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP216HCW/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP216HCW/</a></li>\n<p>The code is here too on my personal github account</p>\n<li>The code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/book-learning-and-building-e2e-test-automation-with-cypress-and-okr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/book-learning-and-building-e2e-test-automation-with-cypress-and-okr</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the help of ChatGPT, I have given me one month to create from scratch a E2E suite for all the websites for FMM. Then, I decide to cope with the mobile applications, mostly working on a JSON API centric validation as mobile application are receiving JSON files to populate data inside and use a meta file in JSON named &#8220;skeleton&#8221; that structure all the mobile applications&#8230; and I decide to allow me one week only for this suite.  </p>\n<p><b>The idea was simple if I had to face any issue, I will ask ChatGPT both for coding, logic, advice, best practices&#8230; etc. I will be like the hero of the novel &#8220;The Dice Man&#8221;. Book that tells the story of a psychiatrist who makes daily decisions based on the casting of a diсe! I have replaced the dice by the AI.</b></p>\n<p><H2>2. From a professional point of view:</H2></p>\n<p>Here is the more detailed version for the scope for each suite:</p>\n<p><b>The objective was double:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Writing down a first version of a robust E2E suite for all the FMM group&#8217;s websites, with Cypress, that enable both Javascript and Gherkin testing. The time limit was fixed at one month.</li>\n<li>Writing down a first version of a robust E2E suite for all the FMM group&#8217;s mobile applications, with Cypress, that enable both Javascript and Gherkin testing. The time limit was fixed at one week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, OK&#8230; It was not only an egoistic personal challenge, it was also more managerial, more team-building oriented!</p>\n<p>Indeed, the initial motivation was to feed a logic of sharing best practices on testing and quality. Concretely, as only actions carry values*, it matters to initiate really the creation of several test suites under Cypress for the team in charge of websites or mobile applications. Consequently, it may consolidate the culture of quality for all.</p>\n<p>But, here again, the contribution&#8217;s effect of the E2E suite must be measured. The creation of these test suites must have tangible consequences: first of all, by increasing the speed of delivery of applications, i.e. several releases per week, while maintaining a high quality level, i.e. no major regressions for each release, so no hot-fixes and then most important no support.</p>\n<p>* It is also called &#8220;Congruence&#8221; which means to have your values and actions aligned.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2022/04/21/15-ways-senior-leaders-can-ensure-their-actions-align-with-their-core-values/?sh=b7f86c64d948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2022/04/21/15-ways-senior-leaders-can-ensure-their-actions-align-with-their-core-values/?sh=b7f86c64d948</a></p>\n<p><H2>E2E Suite Contest for Websites</H2></p>\n<p>The team practically writes, on each of their Jira tickets, almost real Gherkin scripts as an acceptance test that specify the DOD. The challenge was to transform each proto test to effective Gherkin test! So, POs can write their own tests. The suite was supposed to allow management of any combinaison of brand/language. The  suite must be resilient to any test combination both in JS (*.cy.js) and in Gherkin (*.feature). The Gherkin should allow to quickly transpose tests written using the Cypress Studio.</p>\n<p><b>So, here is exactly what has been jotted as rough ideas regarding the E2E suite objectives for websites:</b></p>\n<p><H3>MUST-HAVE</H3></p>\n<ul>\n<li>FUNCTIONNAL: The E2E suite must manage functional priorities e.g. browsing and testing the main navigation. </li>\n<li>OPTIMIZATION: The E2E suite must check pages&#8217; code and structure (meta Open Graph OG) for several and specific purposes e.g. social networks or tracking&#8230;etc.</li>\n<li>DEVICES: The E2E suite must ensure that websites are responsive for (mobile, mobile-landscape, tablet, tablet-landscape, desktop).</li>\n<li>SEO: The E2E suite must consider concerns on SEO (meta data optimisation)</li>\n<li>UX/CONTENT: The E2E suite must check the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; for specific content elements displayed on te websites and validate somehow the webdesign.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><H3>NICE-TO-HAVE</H3><br />\n<b>More feature on additional SEO and on Screen Capture ability.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TODO_1: Add a test on the slug when visiting each page to check the slug, validate the SEO and de facto the fov_parameter without postman test.</li>\n<li>TODO_2: Add a capture when visiting each page for a possible visual human check.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><H2>E2E Suite Contest for mobile applications</H2></p>\n<p>The target for mobile applications was significantly less ambitious. It was simply increasing the ability to test API products, available to mobile applications for consumption. The team would thus be able to distinguish if it is a real mobile application&#8217;s bug or a regression related to an API or infrastructure failure.</p>\n<p>So, in a nutshell, it&#8217;s about testing the existence and validity of JSON inputs called in mobile apps. A review finally quite close to what I formerly did with the help of Newman/Postman. But this time, these tests must be carried out under Cypress in order to standardize testing tools within the teams.</p>\n<p>For information, this test experience under Newman/Postman had given rise to the publication of a first book:</p>\n<h2>A quick journey through API Testing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/a-quick-journey-through-api-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/a-quick-journey-through-api-testing</a></li>\n<li>The book is available for sale on Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07MH81L1X/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07MH81L1X/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The code produced during the contest with the help of ChatGPT</h2>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/migrate_create_parse_website_testing_front_apps_api_cypress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">All the code for the contest/experiment is available on my github account</a></b></p>\n<p>These are mostly working documents but to me, it presents 2 advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To archive part of searches made with ChatGPT&#8217;s help.</li>\n<li>To refine the working method by integrating AI and any additional programming resources that can increase productivity and achievement in obtaining a result, however minimal it may be.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>At the same time, I fully understand that these same documents are sometimes present also more than limited interest for any other person than me! One day, this information will be semi-structured or structured using Obsidian but for now on it has this form&#8230; due both to some laziness and a lack of time 🙂</i></p>\n<p>You can find the following working directories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>001_python_parse_web:</b> how to grab semi-structured data from a  website to use  in tests.</li>\n<li><b>002_package_json_python:</b> handy scripts to generate shortcuts for tedious commands to launch cypress suite with parameters.</li>\n<li><b>003_launcher_suite_cypress:</b> a simple applescript to automate the E2E suite launching.</li>\n<li><b>004_cypress_fov_suite_2e2:</b> A very extensive directory including a large number of working documents. Those are milestones form the creation process of the E2E suites, in particular the prompts to ChatGPT: javascript class explained, decode encode in javascript, grab explore url in python,  parse complex variable in javascript, split class, web scraping in python\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The directories <b>004_cypress_fov_suite_2e2</b> is splitted up in two directories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>004_1_archives_for_code_queries:</b> _depot_code_1.js, _queries_cypress_fov_suite_2e2_2.diff, _queries_cypress_fov_suite_2e2_3.diff</li>\n<li><b>004_2_fov_html_js_python:</b> 001_example_print_loop.py, archives, class_explained_chatgpt, decode_encode_javascript, grab_explore_url, parse_complex_var, split_class, web_scraping_python</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What was the help from ChatGPT?</h2>\n<p><b>Like Marcus Loew, said once: &#8220;I make somebody else do it. Let the other fellow go crazy.&#8221; That is exactly what I am doing!</b></p>\n<h3>1. Delegate the tedious work to ChatGPT (second hand)</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT has proven to be a patient assistant/developer/teacher/lead-dev, pedagogue and available, in short, a little hand, a little pearl and a good-natured adviser with a kindness and benevolence that becomes almost annoying with obsequiousness.</p>\n<p>I shamelessly delegate to him all the thankless tasks, in particular the &#8220;Data wrangling&#8221; which is always very time-consuming in Data science as in all other disciplines.</p>\n<p><i>A little precision on Data wrangling</i></p>\n<p>Data wrangling is the transformation of raw data into a format that is easier to use. But what exactly does it involve? In this post, we find out.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/data-wrangling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/data-wrangling/<br />\n</a></p>\n<h3>2. Use all the ChatGPT&#8217;s logic and analytical mind of this extra Brain (second brain)</h3>\n<p><b>&#8230; And for sure, at the same time, I ask ChatGPT pointed and sophisticated questions. As occasional developer, I need a substantial helping hand on code logic or on best practices to adopt. Exactly, like I would do with a senior developer or software architect! Except I do not bother him 🙂</b></p>\n<p><b>It is therefore definitely a second brain and a second hand*</b></p>\n<p><i>*Do not get confuse, I use the word &#8220;second hand&#8221; not as derogatory but really in the literal meaning, more like an &#8220;extra hand&#8221; that is manipulating things for you!</i></p>\n<p>All this could not be exceptional, the AI&#8217;s irruption is just a new change in my way of working! But these directional changes, these pivots, there have been many of them since I started doing digital.</p>\n<p><b>Two questions then:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What if, as a worker, I refuse to pivot this time&#8230; Boo, Fixed Mindset 🙂 I will be laid off soon. Period.</li>\n<li>What if, as a manager, I refuse to use AI? Obviously, I will have to pay a bit for a Q/A, a JS dev, and a PO too. Instead, I can pay a shiva guy, a kind of prompt engineer that will do both three jobs! Interesting? It gives some clue to understand why companies like Google, Meta are so optimistic on AI&#8230; It is always sane to wonder who benefits from the crime?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>But, for now, let leave a possible political controversy.</b></p>\n<p>In conclusion, for me, the positive thing in using of AI is the ability to ask questions. Getting the correct answer is probably more questionable but on very programmatic concerns, it works! So, as PO, I may disappear and I hope to reinvent myself as little master in &#8220;Prompt Art Design&#8221; syntax!</p>\n<p><H2>More infos</H2></p>\n<ul>\n<li>(essential) ChatGPT by OpenAI!<br /><a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://chat.openai.com/chat</a></li>\n<li>(essential) Google Translate<br /><a href=\"https://translate.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://translate.google.com/</a></li>\n<li>Testing mobile, tablet and desktop devices with Cypress<br /><a href=\"https://maxschmitt.me/posts/cypress-testing-mobile-tablet-desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://maxschmitt.me/posts/cypress-testing-mobile-tablet-desktop</a></li>\n<li>cypress-web-vitals<br /><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-web-vitals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-web-vitals</a></li>\n<li>Testing Web Vitals With Cypress<br /><a href=\"https://dev.to/craigmorten/web-vitals-cypress-testing-3bpj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dev.to/craigmorten/web-vitals-cypress-testing-3bpj</a></li>\n<li>How to Make Writing Performance Tests Easy With Cypress<br /><a href=\"https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/04/21/writing-performance-tests-cypress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/04/21/writing-performance-tests-cypress/</a></li>\n<li>Node.js Modules: Import and use Functions from Another File<br /><a href=\"https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/node-modules-import-and-use-functions-from-another-file/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/node-modules-import-and-use-functions-from-another-file/</a></li>\n<li>URL Decode online<br /><a href=\"https://www.urldecoder.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.urldecoder.io/</a></li>\n<li>Viewport in Cypress<br /><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport</a></li>\n<li>Class in JavaScript (course)<br /><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes</a></li>\n<ul>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>The use of ChatGPT is in many articles and the internet is buzzing with the &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; performance of this large language model trained by OpenAI. </p>\n<p>Indeed, I was eager to test by myself, this &#8220;astonishing&#8221; supposed ability generating human-like text based on the input it receives and can be used to answer questions and engage in conversations with people.</p>\n<p>and&#8230; with no surprise, the answer is YES, it is AMAZING! This permanently will turn upside down, and it already turns upside down, all the established digital functions: P.O, developers, support, or training for instance.</p>\n<p>There are two behaviors facing this major shift: you can put your head in the sand like an ostrich or &#8220;jumping on the bandwagon&#8221;. For those of you who prefer more conceptual explanations to catch the meaning of this dilemma: you can pin yourself between fixed mindset versus growth mindset.</p>\n<p><b>Two remarks:</b></p>\n<p>First, asking Chat GPT about moral issues is pointless and sometimes ludicrous! Knowing if technology is full of prejudices, the answer is yes&#8230; People are said to be the product of their readings, why should it be any different for AI? ChatGPT has been trained on a &#8220;corpus&#8221; i.e. the incredible amount of information on which the algorithm has been trained. Therefore, the AI is only the undoubtedly unconscious and conscious reflection of their authors and the texts chosen by themselves.</p>\n<p>A quick search with &#8220;What is the corpus that has trained Chatgpt&#8221; give some clues!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Chat GPT was trained on a large corpus of text from the internet, which may contain inaccuracies, biases, and cultural misunderstandings. It&#8217;s important for educators to be aware of these limitations and to review and verify the information generated by Chat GPT.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://bonnersferryherald.com/news/2023/feb/16/revolutionizing-education-rise-openais-chat-gpt-mo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bonnersferryherald.com/news/2023/feb/16/revolutionizing-education-rise-openais-chat-gpt-mo/</a></p>\n<p>One last thing, which sounds obvious, it is possible to make Chat GPT &#8220;write&#8221;: a philosophy or history homework, a cover letter for a job, a love letter for someone, a summary of a book that you haven&#8217;t read, a note on a subject you don&#8217;t know, a correspondence on Tinder, some posts for LinkedIn&#8230; Of course, you are entitled to use AI but then in the end you are only fooling yourself! You even risk passing for a dull person that say nothing more than empty platitudes without point of view :). In French, the accurate expression for that is called &#8220;ouvrir le robinet d&#8217;eau tiède&#8221;</p>\n<p>Second, still about the &#8220;corpus&#8221;, as we do not know exactly the corpus of texts on which ChatGPT was trained to perfect its learning, it is certainly obvious that all the documentation relating to the development languages has been included (SQL, PHP, Python, JavaScript and so on&#8230;. etc.) but that they do not necessarily integrate the latest developments of this, we can see this, but it is anecdotal regarding the service provided by Chat GPT.</p>\n<p><b>So, there is much better to do with Chat GPT in any case concerning me. Voilà. Below the results of some experiments: using ChatGPT to comment, understand, transform, or even generate code</b></p>\n<p>Again, the ChatGPT&#8217;s ability is properly amazing! You can rely on ChatGPT to do a substantial part of the job. Of course, some humans will tell you not to do so probably because their job survival is indeed at stake. Afterall, this is human! But, on understanding logic, ChatGPT is properly outstanding, that makes it a formidable ally.  It is an excellent training assistant that beats a lot of online training. It can help when you struggle to understand a codebase that wasn&#8217;t created by you. Navigating through a complex and poorly-organized code — also known as spaghetti code — can be a frustrating and time-consuming task.</p>\n<p>And so, for the rest of some other tedious tasks for P.O, developers, support, or training for instance.</p>\n<p><b>You can find all files on my GitHub account.

      "rendered": "<p>I know the title sound like a clickbait, and I was about to use the F word in it, but I gave up! So, let&#8217;s start with some banalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am often bedeviled by an intense curiosity for a subject. This blog is living proof of that. Responding to this imperative to satisfy this curiosity always leaves me bewildered&#8230; What&#8217;s the point of investigate all this when in the end you can satisfy to be ignorant and claim it? </li>\n<li>Most of the topics below are explored for simplicity more than exhaustivity. So, I will certainly state the obvious on these subjects 🙂</li>\n<li>It also gave a better understanding of Friedrich Nietzsche&#8217;s quote: <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/quotes/bienheureux-les-assoupis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Blessed are the sleepy ones: for they shall soon nod off&#8221;</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, my two last top-of-mind professional concerns were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first concern was that I wanted to extend some Cypress tests to performance testing (Frontend performance or Backend performance) more than functional testing</li>\n<li>The second was I wanted to test also some required Javascript files such Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager with Cypress preferably.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>The constrain was simple: &#8220;Can I do it with Cypress only and not with a tedious integration of new tool or framework for such performance testing?&#8221; As it is p&#8230; in the a&#8230; to manage several tool Ooops!</b></p>\n<p><b>Anyway, during this exploration, I had the chance to document: </b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>load testing principles</li>\n<li>using K6 for load testing</li>\n<li>a quick playwright discovery both with Python and Node</li>\n<li>how to connect lighthouse with Cypress</li>\n<li>how to test Google Analytics with Cypress</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>This post is a quick roundup of this exploration.</b></p>\n<p><b>You can find all files on my GitHub account. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/cypress_playwright_lighthouse_performance_testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/cypress_playwright_lighthouse_performance_testing</a></b></p>\n<pre>\r\n# You will find these 4 directories\r\ncypress_example_1\r\nk6_example_1\r\nplaywright_node_example_1\r\nplaywright_python_example_1\r\n</pre>\n<h2>The genuine cost</h2>\n<p><b>Does a tool&#8217;s genuine cost should include the time spent (learning curb) to reach tool&#8217;s proficiency? My answer is Yes.</b></p>\n<p>For instance, I always try to figure out the time spent to learn a dedicated tool (K6) vs the time spent to tinker an existing and well understood (Cypress) with no success guaranteed. You see the point?</p>\n<p>For sure, it&#8217;s when you begin to master a tool that you see its limits. As often, thanks to an event (bug, regression, error&#8230;), you cruelly realize limits and fragility for your hard-won knowledge! </p>\n<p>Thus, I master a little Cypress and I now see that this framework that I use for E2E tests is not really intended to do anything else!</p>\n<p><b>Choosing and investing in a new tool represents a tremendous cost for a team. </b></p>\n<p>In my case, the constraint that applies is once Cypress has been chosen, it must at least be kept. I know that the grass is always greener elsewhere and I know also that novelty is the modern bait. Of course, it would be tempting to choose another tool like K6 or to change the E2E framework once again and choose Playwright, for example, which is the latest test framework I have heard of.</p>\n<p>It is true that after reading a few articles; It seems obvious that what I was trying to do was obviously more like load testing or performance testing (Frontend performance or Backend performance) than functional testing! </p>\n<p>All my knowledge come from this article! See <a href=\"https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/load-testing-websites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/load-testing-websites/</a></p>\n<h2>Load testing principle</h2>\n<p>I have grabbed some explanations on K6 website, a very famous loading test framework and so a great source of information.</p>\n<p><b>The main question is &#8220;What are the load testing approaches possible?&#8221;</b><br />\nThe answer is always when you approach the load test, first consider the following perspectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Backend vs. frontend performance</li>\n<li>Protocol-based, browser-based, or hybrid load testing</li>\n<li>Component testing vs. end-to-end testing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So where do you stand? According to me, I don&#8217;t know exactly in which category I stand with my need but&#8230; from my understanding if I write down a user story, I will say:</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a PO, I want to test the critical files loading and ensure that these files are &#8220;present&#8221; in the CMS (Backend) or on the website (Frontend) before I really start to test the functionalities themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To make it abundantly clear, I add that preferably, loading testing and functional testing will be written with the same framework e.g., Cypress so all actions will be chained in user stories written down in Cypress&#8217; testing files.</p>\n<p>Indeed, by analogy, to what is written above, it is overall logical in terms of scheduling. For instance, a lumberjack, before sawing a tree, make sure that the ax is operational, so he will not put the cart before the horse like we said! Capisce? &#x1f90c;</p>\n<p>I should answer to K6 question above, I am right in the middle of the 3 points! Therefore, my main test is to make sure that all &#8220;critical&#8221; JavaScript and CSS files are correctly loaded to then launch an E2E test battery on an enriched editor like Gutenberg in WordPress for example.</p>\n<p>Like often, at the same time, by exploring this loading test question, I have explored 2 but secondary testing issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First secondary test is how to make sure that Tag Commander is correctly loaded because all users&#8217; actions are tracked down in Google Analytics. </li>\n<li>Second secondary test I want to leverage on Google&#8217;s Lighthouse directly through Cypress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>For those who wonder what Google&#8217;s Lighthouse, here the baseline extracted from the official website.</i></p>\n<blockquote><p>Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more. </p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/</a></i></p>\n<h2>Few words on Playwright with Node</h2>\n<p>My idea was once again to measure the qualities of playwright. For the comparison conditions to be identical to test frameworks such as Cypress, CodeceptJS, it is this version of playwright with Node that must be installed. The logic of playwright is then remarkably close to the ones mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>Few words on playwright with Python</h2>\n<p>I found much interest in working in Python as it is often the &#8220;on-top language&#8221; that drove my own automation. By the way as I often say, it is much interesting to learn Python instead of Ruby or Bash because you can thousands of things in Python, since is become a standard for data-science or for Google, the language Go may have my favor one day. For Go is the coming underdog!<br />\nAnyway, apart for the digression on programming, for testing framework, you must deal with JavaScript!  And to make a true comparison of playwright between Cypress, CodeceptJS, you need to use the distribution made on Node. According to me, thought quick search, there are much more resources for playwright node on GitHub that in Python.</p>\n<p><H2>More infos</H2></p>\n<ul>\n<H3>Cypress Ressources</H3></p>\n<li>Using

That are just premises for a future Dashboard.

Why do I release all as a post, just because like I said many times before in this blog: It is a psychological &#8220;terminator&#8221; to end a book writing process and in this chaotic jumble here are &#8220;golden nuggets&#8221; to discover.</p>\n<p>I try to gather all technique to visualize workflows to spur value delivery instead of producing waste* from OKR to strategic planning </p>\n<p><i>*Making sh&#8230; to be even more specific</i></p>\n<p>A major source of inspiration is the asana.com or atlassian.com as they are making promotion for such methodologies as often their platforms offer enablers to implement such way of working. </p>\n<p><H1>1. Hoshin Kanri for Strategic Planning, grabbed from asana</H1></p>\n<h2>1.1 Hoshin Kanri</h2>\n<p>Never heard of it before but I am naturally keen of the Japanese approach. </p>\n<p>First because Hoshin Kanri &#8220;is a strategic planning tool that businesses use to connect company-wide objectives to the day-to-day work of individual contributors&#8221;. That sounds interesting. Second, as I was reading at the same time the &#8220;The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming&#8221; where I grab some overarching concepts on work in general. Here they are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of offering a hundred explanations, would not practicing the philosophy be the best way? When the specialist decides to take his own advice and begins to do as he says, he breaks down the walls that enclose him in his specialization. We listen to him then as we could not before, because he speaks with authority &#8212; not out of knowledge only, but out of knowledge and experience together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the same, Masanobu Fukuoka advocates for a great counterpower to anarchic activity that produce mostly waste: the do-nothing. This is not against work but against unnecessary work. It is sometimes a commonsense response to expert authority: &#8220;How about not doing this? How about not doing that?&#8221; </p>\n<p>Very thoughtful advice when you are exercising as a PO on the opportunity or not to develop a feature. Indeed, as a PO who should know why you are developing some product&#8217;s features but also why you do not develop some other.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Hoshin Kanri can be combined with Agile methodology</p>\n<p>I gave the direct ressource to some best posts that I found on Hoshin Kanri, one by Asana, the other gave a good a good Hoshin Kanri Planning Matrix.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hoshin-planning-matrix-small.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hoshin-planning-matrix-small.png\" width=\"598\" height=\"473\" alt=\"Notes and Takeaways on Hoshin Kanri, OKRs...\"></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://asana.com/en/resources/hoshin-kanri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://asana.com/en/resources/hoshin-kanri</a></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://bscdesigner.com/hoshin-kanri.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bscdesigner.com/hoshin-kanri.htm</a></p>\n<p>All the ressources from asana.com are great even on OKRs.

Other Ressources on How to write Effective OKRS</h1>\n<p>When you have not a clue on the nature of something e.g., OKR for instance. You call Google to rescue and try to find some advanced examples. In my case, I was looking for OKRs applied to Q/A. So, here is a shortlist of ressources including my book now!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>QA / Tester OKR Examples : <a href=\"https://www.keka.com/qa-tester-okr-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.keka.com/qa-tester-okr-examples</a></li>\n<li>How To Write Effective OKRs (With 60+ OKR Examples): <a href=\"https://clickup.com/blog/okr-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://clickup.com/blog/okr-examples/</a></li>\n<li>25+ Real OKR Examples for Different Teams: <a href=\"https://gtmhub.com/resources/articles/okr-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://gtmhub.com/resources/articles/okr-examples</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some personal remarks on OKRs from what I learn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting OKR gave sometime a chance to say NO to anything that differ from the goals&#8217; alignment unless you decide as a team to change your OKR. </li>\n<li>If as a team we set OKRs, that is the best way to expose learning value from a success or a failure. It is key for progress otherwise; it is like progressing in the dark! </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>3. Takeaways from John Doerr in &#8220;Measure What matters&#8221;</h1>\n<p>John Doerr in &#8220;Measure What matters&#8221; has plenty of wised aphorisms and pratical advises turn to action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ideas are easy; Execution is everything.&#8221; – John Doerr<br />\n<i>Source: <a href=\"https://www.whatmatters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.whatmatters.com/</a></i></p>\n<p>There are many good and useful parts. I have just taken for this post the one about scoring OKRs, and sorry for the reference but John Doerr is quoting the one used by Google.</p>\n<p><H2>3.1 Two rules for notation &#038; calculation for OKRs</H2></p>\n<p><b>The simplest, cleanest way to score an objective is by averaging the percentage completion rates of its associated key results. Google uses a scale of 0 to 1.0.</b></p>\n<pre>\r\n# color rules for indicators progress\r\n0.7 to 1.0 = green.* (We delivered.)\r\n0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress, but fell short of completion.)\r\n0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress.)\r\n</pre>\n<p>Once for all, you can even apply the OKRs system for self-assessment and not only for organisation but you may pervert the OKRs system as you may fall quickly into the TODO&#8217;s list nightmare.</p>\n<p>Advice always pragmatic and simplistic&#8230; People love figures and color. It gave both a point of seriousness and value visual thinking. On these latter, you can find more in &#8220;The Back of The Napkin&#8221; by Dan Roam. Some indication on OKRs notation used by Google especially Visual semiology more simply the colors choice! Helpful when you draw a board for OKRs, and you want to briefly know the indicators progress.</p>\n<pre>\r\n# example of calculation success rate\r\n# take each indicator progress for your key result and make the sum\r\nKey result #1: 0.5\r\nKey result #2: 0.7\r\nKey result #3: 0.3\r\nObjective: (0.5 + 0.7 + 0.3)/3  = 1.5/3 = 0.5\r\n</pre>\n<p>Again, a very concise definition on OKRs and its ability to fit together with Agility. By reducing the definition to the maximum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agility is the ability to manage uncertainty to change direction with relatively little impact based on newly discovered information — which happens ALL the time in software development. </li>\n<li>The OKRs setting goal method lean on two simple components. OKRs are intended to state a qualitative goal for a team (the Objective), business unit or company that is aspirational and time bound and then to provide quantitative measures (the Key Results) to assess whether you have achieved this qualitative goal. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last remark, the common mistake in software development is miss targeting the overall purpose of the feature development; <b>&#8220;The only thing you’ve measured is your ability to get code to customer. More code does not equal more value.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>Finally, I also advise the reading of more &#8220;Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results (Empowered Teams)&#8221;</p>\n<h1>4.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I am currently intensively working with Cypress, a well-known UAT (aka User Acceptance Testing) framework, to write some tests! Within this time, in parallel, I made a lot of POC with Selenium and Beautiful Soup. From what I understood and read about Selenium, there is a strong similarity between Selenium&#8217;s logic and a UAT framework. Even though, it is more tedious to make Selenium work as you must crank out a lot of code with sometimes arcane syntax! There is not this handy abstraction layer like in Cypress or CodeceptsJS. Anyway, these tools&#8217; common fate is to execute automation use cases in a browser and Selenium can do a lot.</p>\n<p>The 2 main actions I wanted to implement with Selenium was: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scraping web pages: You can definitely use Selenium combined with Beautiful Soup to scraping elements from pages&#8217; web application.</li>\n<li>Task Automation: Anyway, the more I discovered Selenium the more I was wondering: What is the practical and learning value regarding automation some P.O boring daily tasks jobs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_selenium_web_scraping_automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for using_selenium_web_scraping_automation</a></b></p>\n<p><i>You can find another post on this blog about Web scraping, Beautiful Soup, Selenium: <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/2021/01/web-scraping-beautifulsoup-selenium-various-explorations-in-web-scraping-with-python-and-jumping-timidly-in-surveillance-capitalism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Web scraping, Beautiful Soup, Selenium – Various explorations in web scraping with Python and jumping timidly in surveillance capitalism</a></i></p>\n<h2>1. Requirement: Install XAMPP to have a local WP Frontend and Backend</h2>\n<p>If you want to have the exact same development environment, you need to have a local WP installed and declare in your hosts file the domain e.g., https://cypress.mydomain.priv/wordpress/ that leads to WP.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download XAMPP <a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.apachefriends.org</a></li>\n<li>Download WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://wordpress.org/download/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<pre language=\"bash\">\r\n# edit your hosts on a mac\r\nsudo -s\r\nvi /etc/hosts\r\n\r\n\r\n# type I for insert\r\n\r\n# cut and paste the domain cypress.mydomain.priv\r\n127.0.0.1 cypress.mydomain.priv\r\n\r\n# save ctrl+C then :wq\r\n# you are good\r\n\r\n# quit the root session\r\nexit\r\n\r\n# just ping in the console, to ensure that it is OK\r\nping localhost\r\nping 127.0.0.1\r\nping cypress.mydomain.priv\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<h2>2. Scraping web pages for UAT testing</h2>\n<p>Scraping is fun! Indeed, it is like poaching or reaping what has been sown! It can be even illegal&#8230; More prosaically, let&#8217;s say it is one of the very first gestures in data science. To bring together your dataset, you often have to extract this data from various sources including websites.</p>\n<p>For this post, as my focus is on UAT testing, my purpose was different. For instance, in a cypress test, I needed for a test to have a up-to-date main navigation labels array. So, instead of looking every time and in every language the labels, I made a script with Selenium and Beautiful Soup to do so.</p>\n<p><b>The first point is straightforward; you can find some code on my GitHub account in the directory: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_selenium_web_scraping_automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for selenium_web_scraping</a></b></p>\n<h2>3. Tasks Automation for P.O Job</h2>\n<p>This time, I had more ambition! For me, any online repeatable task I do as P.O should be automated so I can focus only on what matters. For instance, I manage Backlogs through Jira tickets. The project&#8217;s big picture is then shared on Dashboards with teams. So far, nothing abnormal.</p>\n<p>But, on average, I create a lot of tickets and as a team we are embarking between 30 and 40 tickets per Sprint. I also manage the backlog itself that contains between 40 and 50 spare tickets. Nothing is more boring than typing in Jira, so why do not automate ticket creation in Jira from a .csv or .json file.</p>\n<p><b>On reflection, there is an import tool in Jira, so it is bit useless&#8230; Do not reinvent the wheel and meditate the Peter Drucker quote below! But what about handling with automation the numerous Google Forms or MS Office forms that I am working with or automate WordPress post publication for this blog&#8230; If I take a moment to think, there are numerous tasks that can be automated. </b><br />\nThe decisions making process is easy: just ask yourself few questions to decide if a task can be automated or not. Sampled from Lucas Soares&#8217;s post, here is the 2 questions: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do I do this periodically? </li>\n<li>Does it involve repeatable processes with little or no smart decision making involved? </li>\n<li>I will add a third one, especially important to me: &#8220;Is there an existing solution apart programming?&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>If the answer for the 2 first questions are yes, and the third question is no then you should automate that task. </b></p>\n<h2>4. Some feedback on this experience with Selenium</h2>\n<p>Two practical advices issued from my experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For Selenium, my advice is the following: you&#8217;d better decompose your use cases to be sure that Selenium sees the stuff&#8230; For instance, I lost few hours to determine how to click on a specific submit button in WordPress e.g., save draft or publish. I finally discovered that it was probably because the button was to up and the test was to down on the page at this moment! I should have applied the rule: always start from general to specific and not the other way round. </li>\n<li>To parse the CSV, I have deliberately implemented Pandas. Using Pandas to parse a CSV ease your data frame manipulation. You can even think some preliminary data science filtering before creating stuff for instance. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230; and food for thought</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More reflection on today job scope, in many full or half &#8220;Bullshit jobs*&#8221;, agile organization included, you are spending valuable time to do useless things like filling out different kind of submission forms! You spend a lot of time: creating tickets, publishing on confluence, create shareable google doc, preparing communication releases, sending support mails&#8230; I hope for you that you added value is somewhere else. With the method showed below, using Python&#8217;s Selenium framework, you can decide to automate typing any form from Google forms to Jira ticket form, WordPress post or in CMS of any kind. <i>* <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber</a></i></li>\n<li>For some, sky is the limit! For me, to limit the task automation reflection, I always have in mind this Peter Drucker&#8217;s quote: &#8220;There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#8221; It must be your compass for task automation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Few extras: take-aways on Popcornflow and the Law of Two Feet</h2>\n<p>Like always, I tied practice with theories I heard of! So incidentally, this time I modestly deepened Popcorn Flow by Claudio Perrone and hovered quickly the Law of Two Feet. You can find quick notes on my GitHub account at </p>\n<p><b>Conclusion: Well, what conclusion withdraw from those experiences. What work for me may not work for the other&#8230; That automation is maybe overkill and as a P.O, I should push the team to execute this stuff instead of doing it by myself. Anyway, it freed me up a lot of free time for other things than work while building trust within the whole team!

      "rendered": "<p>To a certain  point, self-assessment can turn to self-harassment. I guess, most of us have experiment the &#8220;evil&#8221; todolist syndrom e.g the 10 things to eat, the 3 books to read, the 5 places to visit, the 7 python librairies to use&#8230; todolists that torment us by controlling what we do and highlighting what we haven&#8217;t! </p>\n<p>A modern practice that denotes a very contemporary obsession with performance. This obsession constantly accentuates our tendency to treat ourselves like a machine or like a company where it is only a question of productivity, efficiency and effectiveness!</p>\n<p>However, these 3 notions are eminently relative because they are personal. So, we can legitimately wonder if productivity is not a myth, multitasking is not useless or even the best productivity hack is almost always to do less!</p>\n<p>Beyond these simple thoughts, let&#8217;s say that workflow&#8217;s optimization or the industrialization of certain tasks has limits especially for a job of P.O.</p>\n<p>As a P.O, I always want to delegate tedious and boring chores to a computer for instance this time I made up my mind about these 2 purposes (again a todolist):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Use voice assistant to automatize some day-to-day P.O tasks such as creating new ticket, lauching tests&#8230; etc so I can do more while expending less effort.</b></li>\n<li><b>Complete my Python self-training with new skills on how to log and how to test some personal applications that I wrote in Python to facilate debugging and improve overall quality.</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>To be totally transparent enough, I wanted also to explore the python ability to generate automatically a PPT for sprint review based on a Jira ticket list! But making the script took more time than manually make the google doc based on a template, so I also dropped this subject! I have left few links towards ressources about this topic below.</i></p>\n<p><b>Well, I must admit that I failed either the subjects were too complex for me as all these goes far beyond my ability to make development or either the results were insignificant in regard of what I was expecting especially for voice assistant!</b> </p>\n<p>With the voice assistant, I was also worry by the fact that I would have to talk with my computer like some kind of crazy dude&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really like the experience and neither did people around me 🙂</p>\n<p>So I pivoted. So, instead of investing on means (hard skills) e.g mastering python, I reinvested on method by revisiting some useful Kanban concepts (soft skills) just to know how to handle my frustration and refine my objectives. </p>\n<p>Anyway, despite the fact that I did not get rid of some P.O chores, this brief reading was a real occasion to take some good hacks from Kanban. As I hate cumbersome and convoluted explanations here are below some of my essential but partial takeaways.</p>\n<p><i>I found great summaries in Keyvan Akbary Learning Notes but reading the books itself is always a must&#8230; See <a href=\"https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes</a></i> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfinished tasks vie for our attention, causing intrusive thoughts that ultimately impede productivity and increase the opportunity for error.</li>\n<li>A P.O must be tech literate, not tech fluent in order to make good trade-off decisions. Programming is far from being essential, the only asset is that you start sometime to think like a developer or a tek guy to provide better explanation for a possible product feature.</li>\n<li>The key for improving quality is to reduce the quantity of work-in-progress. Shorter iterations will drive higher quality. So, mind the WIP and think lead time. I rename &#8220;lead time&#8221; as &#8220;human sizeable&#8221;. Keynes used to say &#8220;In the long run, we are all dead&#8221;, so the delay between from starting to done as to be reasonable for a human being especially in software development.</li>\n<li>Frequent releases build trust. The product is the message so reducing WIP shortens lead time and frequent releases build trust and confidence within the team and with external teams. Trust is event driven, frequent gestures or events enhance trust more than larger gestures made only occasionally. Small gestures often cost nothing but build more trust than large, expensive gestures bestowed occasionally. This &#8220;small gestures&#8221; are also strongly advised in Corporate Hacking and the smallest action must have the highest emotional impact on teams.</li>\n<p><b>Well anyway, I end up pitifully this exploration in Python and give away the code exactly where I stopped. It was urgent to stop what turned out evidently as an evil never-ending WIP.</b></p>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_explorations_audio_log_unit_test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for python_explorations_audio_log_unit_test</a></b>\n</ul>\n<h2>1. Voice assistant or speak with Python</h2>\n<p>Well, I know now that voice over computer is working and it is promising! Good for me.  But, I am definitely reluctant to talk to my computer and become a noisy bird for colleagues and family so I have decided to remain silent. Either my accent sucks in English but many orders given such as launch a script or open a browser were seldom successful attempts! Instead of saving me time, I was pissed off and wasted time trying to get my personal voice assistant as obtuse as a mule to work.</p>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_explorations_audio_log_unit_test/speech_to_text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for speech_to_text</a></b></p>\n<h2>2. First steps with unit testing in Python</h2>\n<p>No doubt that Unit testing belongs to the developer&#8217;s teams. As a PO, you should have a eye on this KPI, unit testing coverage percentage. This coding is made during all the product life-cycle, if not you are creating technical debt, my friend!</p>\n<p>Unit testing makes it easy to fix the problems as the developers come to know which particular component of the system or software has the issues and the developers can fix that particular unit.</p>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_explorations_audio_log_unit_test/unit_testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for unit_testing</a></b></p>\n<h2>3. Using log in Python</h2>\n<p>Well, like anyone who start to develop, you are usually using a print command to figure out where is the problem or bug. Print debugging is deceptively quick and simple. But it often requires multiple iterations of rerunning the program before you display the information you need to know to fix your bug. </p>\n<p>That is the reason why, I have decided to discover log in Python even so it is like &#8220;swatting flies with a sledge hammer&#8221; in my case, more commonly said overkill.</p>\n<p>Using debugger or set up logfiles for your script might seem slower than simply inserting a print() call, but it saves you time in the long run according to all developpers.</p>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_explorations_audio_log_unit_test/using_log_python\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for using_log_python</a></b></p>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b><br />\nOne for all, I certainly confuse several concepts such as productivity, automation or continuous improvement! All this with the childish desire to do the minimum! Well, I guess I am closer to a kaizen mindset where you improve on daily basis the way you work than the &#8220;throw-it-all-and-start-fresh&#8221; method. Never to late to learn. I will also think twice about this Peter Drucker&#8217;s sentence that I like: &#8221; There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<h3>AUDIO SPEECH-TO-TEXT</h3>\n<li>On github, some public repositories matching with voice-assistant<br /><a

      "rendered": "<p>After, a getaway in the NFT&#8217;s universe with Python, Streamlit, it was probably time to return to some real mediocre issues that often animate a professional life!<br />\n<b>I started seriously working with Cypress, another UAT (User Acceptance Testing) testing framework. Same exploration like I did with another UAT (User Acceptance Testing) testing framework named CodeceptJS.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeceptJS 3 ‐ supercharged End 2 End Testing<br /><a href=\"https://codecept.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://codecept.io/</a></li>\n<li>Cypress &#8211; JavaScript End to End Testing Framework<br /><a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cypress.io/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>You can grab the source for this post and some other resource on my GitHub account: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/migration_codeceptjs_to_cypress_write_javascript_class\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Code for migration_codeceptjs_to_cypress_write_javascript_class</a></b></p>\n<h2>Migration issues from CodeceptJS to Cypress</h2>\n<p>With CodeceptJS, as PO, I managed to create an E2E suite with more than a hundred tests that allow an automatic and almost secure acceptance testing for the application. So, migrate the all stuff to Cypress raises questions&#8230; Here is my interrogations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to migrate this CodeceptJS E2E suite to Cypress preserving whatsoever most of the work already done? <b>Briefly, the main question remains how to make the best of your legacy code?</b></li>\n<li>How can you ensure, both in Cypress or in CodeceptJS, that the testing code is correct when you write a JavaScript Function or a Class without waiting that the test finished? <b>So, how can I fasten the testing writing process?</b></li>\n<li><b>Last, more personal, can I apply the good practices learned in Python to JavaScript by writing Classes for instance.</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are the questions that I wanted to answer during this migration.</p>\n<p><H2>Lessons from this migration</H2><br />\nWell, if you replace <code>I.</code> by <code>cy.</code> and you are almost good 🙂 No kidding but thanks to Node, the principles and syntax are not so different from one framework to another so the logic and even the conversion can be easily made.</p>\n<p><b>As the logic was the same, with this migration, the challenge was more to be a cut above with Cypress from the very first E2E testing suite made with CodeceptJS! Unfortunately, du to security reason, I cannot release the code both from my E2E suite made in Cypress or in CodeceptJS. I just show a very small piece of the same code converted just to give a glimpse on what has been done.</b></p>\n<p><b>Extract in CodeceptJS&#8217; syntax</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\r\nI.say('\\n--- TESTING VIDEO', 'red');\r\nI.click('//*[@id=\"acces-panel-collapse\"]/div/a[11]');\r\nI.wait(2)\r\n\r\n// Fill title\r\nI.fillField('//*[@id=\"video_title\"]', 'Video '+globalVariables.startDateString+' '+globalVariables.RandomString+''); \r\nI.fillField('//*[@id=\"video_youtubeId\"]', ''+globalValues.VIDEO_YOUTUBE_ID_TESTING+''); \r\nI.fillField('//*[@id=\"video_url\"]', ''+globalValues.VIDEO_MP4_URL+''); \r\n\r\n// Add a media\r\nI.click(''+selectImageDefault+'');\r\nI.say('--- Add a media image '+globalVariables.RandomImageInsertSmall+'');\r\n\r\n/* code omitted for brevity */\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>The same extract converted in Cypress&#8217; syntax</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\r\ncy.log('\\n--- TESTING VIDEO')\r\ncy.xpath('//*[@id=\"acces-panel-collapse\"]/div/a[11]').click()\r\ncy.wait(2000);\r\n\r\n// Fill title\r\ncy.xpath('//*[@id=\"video_title\"]').type('Video '+globalVariables.startDateString+' '+globalVariables.RandomString+'')\r\ncy.xpath('//*[@id=\"video_youtubeId\"]').type('+globalValues.VIDEO_YOUTUBE_ID_TESTING+') \r\ncy.xpath('//*[@id=\"video_url\"]', '').type(''+globalValues.VIDEO_MP4_URL+'') \r\n\r\n\r\n// Add a media\r\ncy.get(''+selectImageDefault+'').click({force: true})\r\ncy.log('--- Add a media image '+globalVariables.RandomImageInsertSmall+'')\r\n\r\n/* code omitted for brevity */\r\n</pre>\n<h2>My todolist for migration to CodeceptJS to Cypress</h2>\n<p>So, here is in extenso the roadmap/todolist that I wrote to myself with the asserted objective to rely as much as possible on the existing tests written with CodeceptJS (logic, functions, variables&#8230;): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To facilitate migration and do the less work as possible to migrate from CodeceptJS to Cypress. So, managing the minimum of files by making Class, Functions, Variables as much as possible.</li>\n<li>To make the tests more complete, agnostic and resilient while remaining USABLE! Basically, less brittleness more robustness in the tests so that pass regardless the staging environment or any external parameters&#8230; etc. It was also the occasion not to lecture on how to write tests but paradoxically balance the abstraction level. <b>Indeed, to abstract is to simplify but the greater the degree of abstraction is, the more complex the formulation is, and vice versa.</b></li>\n<li>To ensure that all E2E tests pass indifferently in the runner (PO) or in the console (DEV) and ultimately that they must be used to support a GO in production.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This shortlist is based on the advantages and disadvantages encountered with CodeceptJS. Accordingly, the roadmap/todolist was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> TASK_1 :: Check main navigation with a maximum of abstraction</li>\n<li> TASK_2 :: Create function for each type of content (article, edition, &#8230;etc). </li>\n<li> TASK_3 :: Use as much as possible env file to be able to launch the test on any combination for brand/lang or set of parameters e.g cypress.json or cypress.env.json, [brand-lang].conf.env.json</li>\n<li> TASK_4 :: Generate reports for cypress (mochawesome, allure)\n<li> TASK_5 :: Leveraging on node and declare scripts commands in package.json to shortcut actions</li>\n<li> TASK_6 :: Using GITBASH on windows for Automation (a more personal and practical issue)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Even thought these tasks may enter in conflict with the Best Practices<br />\nrecommended by Cypress: <a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices</a> e.g. Unnecessary Waiting</b></p>\n<h2>First conclusions on this migration</h2>\n<p>For any evolution, I finally manage a minimum. It means manipulating almost only two files. I frequently modify them for the sake of the testing and the web application quality!</p>\n<p><b>Most of the time I am manipulating only 2 files. Less is more.</b><br />\n<code>/cypress/support/commands.js</code><br />\n<code>/cypress/fixtures/allValues.js</code></p>\n<p><b>Concretely, what are the immediate benefices:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Testing information is no disseminated in every test’s files.\n<li>The file structure test is always the same as I am using naming conventions everywhere both from filenames to keywords.</li>\n<li>Duplication and reuse are easy as everything is in the file commands.js.

Indeed, it is annoying both inside Cypress as inside CodeceptJS to write a JavaScript Function or a Class and wait until the test finished to ensure that your code is correct!</b> So, in a javascript development environment, writing javascript chunks, focused on logic first, is a much handier approach. That is the reason why I learn how to build-up a dev env with Node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>So, below the answers, developed during this migration, to the 2 minors questions above.</b></p>\n<p><H2>Quickly understanding the OOP Class Concept (productivity)</H2></p>\n<p>So, what is a Class? Class is the core-concept in Object-oriented programming. You can apply this effective approach to write programs in any language (Python, PHP and also Javascript). In object-oriented programming, you will write classes that are abstraction or meta-description for real-world things and situations, and you will create objects based on these classes.</p>\n<p>I will use Python to create this class but the principle is the same for JavaScript. For instance, let&#8217;s abstract a Student, a Dog or a Cube&#8230; you can find thousands of examples where you have to define with unique traits the object you want to describe. Think meta description and will get the features of your object.</p>\n<p>To making an object from a class, you will do what is called an instantiation and then you work with instances of a class.</p>\n<p>One of the Class&#8217;s benefice is when you and other programmers write code based on the same kind of logic, you&#8217;ll be able to understand each other&#8217;s work. You can share the logic even from on language to another, that is exactly what I do from Python to Javascript and vice-versa. As you can see below it exists a logic equivalence between classes made in Javascript or in Python. Personally, I have improved the Class concept understanding through Python learning so I am less reluctant to use the class&#8217;s concept in Javascript.</p>\n<p><b>Creating and using a Class</b><br />\nYou can model almost anything using classes. Let&#8217;s start by writing simples classes for a Cube, a Student or a Dog&#8230; that represents any of these object, person or animal. You can define the characteristics that represent that element.</p>\n<p>For instance, what do we know about most Student? Well, they all have a name, age, university and a program. We also know that most students pass exam and get grade for those exam. Those four pieces of information (name, age, university and program) and those two behaviors (register and pass exam) will go in our Student class because they&#8217;re common to most students. </p>\n<p>This class will tell Python how to make an object representing a Student.

Personally, the decision to migrate from CodeceptJS to Cypress is absolutely not justified from my practical point of view! It is unnecessary extra work. The only valid reason is that I am the only one to manipulate this E2E suite, playing de facto a role of developer or a quality manager in addition to my role as PO. This situation is creating a dangerous imbalance by creating a bottleneck in the delivery as the responsibility is not really being supported within the team. However, where there is a learning value there is hope! So, to accept this migration is no more work solely but work as team. That&#8217;s not politics, that&#8217;s laziness.</p>\n<h2>More infos</h2>\n<ul>\n<p><b>JavaScript Development Environment</b></p>\n<li>Setup JavaScript Development Environment<br /><a href=\"https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/env-setup-for-javascript-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/env-setup-for-javascript-development</a></li>\n<li>Building a JavaScript Development Environment<br /><a href=\"https://www.lvguowei.me/post/building-js-dev-env/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.lvguowei.me/post/building-js-dev-env/</a></li>\n<li>How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS<br /><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment-on-macos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment-on-macos</a></li>\n<li>Set up your Node.js and Express development environment<br /><a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-node-js-and-express-development-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-node-js-and-express-development-environment</a></li>\n<li>Set up your Node.js and Express development environment<br /><a href=\"https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-build-a-reusable-javascript-development-environment-f13146b77fdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-build-a-reusable-javascript-development-environment-f13146b77fdf</a></li>\n<p><b>Cypress</b></p>\n<li>Configure Cypress Tests to Run on Multiple Environments<br /><a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/configure-cypress-tests-to-run-on-multiple-environments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dzone.com/articles/configure-cypress-tests-to-run-on-multiple-environments</a></li>\n<li>Cypress Test Suite: Grouping and Organizing Tests<br /><a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/cypress-test-suite-grouping-and-organizing-tests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dzone.com/articles/cypress-test-suite-grouping-and-organizing-tests</a></li>\n<li>CypressJs by singhrajkr<br />\n<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/SinghRajKr/CypressJs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/SinghRajKr/CypressJs</a></li>\n<p><b>JavaScript Class</b></p>\n<li>JavaScript Class by javascripttutorial.net<br /><a href=\"https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-class/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-class/</a></li>\n<li>JavaScript Classes by javatpoint.com<br /><a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-classes</a></li>\n<li>JavaScript Classes by toolsqa.com<br /><a href=\"https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/javascript-classes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/javascript-classes/</a></li>\n<li>Classes and Objects in JavaScript<br /><a href=\"https://www.tutorialslogic.com/javascript/classes-and-objects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tutorialslogic.com/javascript/classes-and-objects</a></li>\n<li>JavaScript Classes Explained With Examples<br /><a href=\"https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-classes-explained-with-examples-c10d0426834b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-classes-explained-with-examples-c10d0426834b</a></li>\n<li>Define Class in JavaScript<br /><a href=\"https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/class-in-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/class-in-javascript</a></li>\n<li>Define Class in JavaScript<br /><a href=\"https://appdividend.com/2019/05/22/javascript-class-example-how-to-use-class-in-javascript-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://appdividend.com/2019/05/22/javascript-class-example-how-to-use-class-in-javascript-tutorial/</a></li>\n<li>Error Handling in JavaScript<br /><a href=\"https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/error-handling-in-javascript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/error-handling-in-javascript/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Recently, I had to take an interest in the metaverse, which obviously seems to be the future of the web aka Web3! Without overplaying the early adopter, it would be a shame to miss such this phenomenon. Incidentally, it was also an opportunity to discover NFTs and blockchain and even more concretely on how to create my own NFT&#8217;s collection.</p>\n<p>One more thing, that would be lying not to say that I was impressed like anyone by the price records broken by some NFTs. For those who still doubting, it testifies that the NFT market could be prone to speculation! For the moment, it seems the next big thing and there is no obvious reason to justify such prices except that is has become the “zeitgeist” where people are excited about NFTs and the price goes up! Market laws at its purest!</p>\n<p><b>But let&#8217;s get back to our subject to create what is commonly called Generative Art Collections.

Indeed, the purpose of the NFT is to be exposed and then sold for the lucky ones, therefore, creating these NFTs is a prerequisite.</b></p>\n<p>As indicated in the introduction, I especially tackled the Generative art collections issue which is particularly based on randomness.</p>\n<p>I must admit that there are many other NFT&#8217;s types but I will leave them aside just like the key success factors in the launching strategy for NFTS collection such as concept, segment, artistic style, community, rarity through traits or interoperability!</p>\n<h2>An essential piece of the NFT collection: the traits</h2>\n<p>The essential concept in the creation of a collection is that of traits which will be the digital basis on which you will generate your NFTs. You can work with Photoshop or another image-editing software and create one layer per trait for your NFT.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the example given in the project named &#8220;Pycasso&#8221; where you will generate faces that look to like the ones painted by Pablo Picasso.<br />\nI have define 6 Parent Traits and for each parent, it variates between 6 to 4 Sub-Traits. The layers you&#8217;ll need to build in Photoshop might look something like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n--- background: Blue, Orange, Red, Green, Pink, Dust\r\n--- eye: Scary, Sleepy, Friendly, Clumsy, Phoenician, Egyptian\r\n--- eyebrow: Precious, Bold, Julia, Piaf, Fillon\r\n--- face: Nothing, Egyptian, Cocteau, Tillet, Merrick, Ball\r\n--- mouth: Fish, Flower, Wisper, Silent, Trump\r\n--- nose : Greek, Potato, Socrates, Tubular\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then, you can play with &#8220;rarity&#8221; so one subtrait can appear less frequently in the collection, making the NFTs that possess them rarer and potentially more valuable. </p>\n<p>Also think about the way you want that traits appear in the NFT e.g the eyebrow closed to the eye&#8230; well in the case of Picasso, you can decide to put the eyebrow far far far away from the eye as it seems the Pablo&#8217;s Pattern!</p>\n<p>Just export automatically each layer as png transparent and then you are good, you have your basis to generate your NFT collection.</p>\n<p><b>You can find more info on rarity by playing with some NFT generators gathered on my GitHub account used to illustrated this post.</b></p>\n<p><b>Rarity is important since it creates scarcity which in turn creates value. You will implement rarity in the traits by assigning weights to the different types within one trait. The total of the weights should always add up to 100.</b></p>\n<p>Remember that most NFT collections posted on NFT tools, such as Rarity, are ranked by their rarity, and that contributes to their value. Like I said before, some of the most popular NFT marketplaces are: Mintable, Rarible, OpenSea.</p>\n<h2>What is NFT Metadata?</h2>\n<p>NFT metadata is the core of an NFT. It is a JSON document that often contains the following: NFT’s name, Description of the NFT, Link to the hosted image, Traits&#8230; </p>\n<p>This NFT metadata will be the input of your NFT smart contract which you will deploy on the Ethereum network in the third part.</p>\n<h2>Hosting for Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</h2>\n<p>Regarding the NFT collection hosting, a few words because if your intention is to go further, you will necessarily have to be interested in it to ensure the sustainability of your future collection. You will rely on Interplanetary File System (IPFS).</p>\n<p><b>Instead of locating a specific file at a specific domain, as with a URL address, IPFS addresses allow you to identify any piece of content as long as someone on the IPFS network is hosting it. This creates a decentralized method of data storage that can be used to host or backup your NFT collection.</b></p>\n<p>You can explore and choose Pinata for instance : <a href=\"https://www.pinata.cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinata.cloud/</a></p>\n<p>This service will help you to secure your NFT data and make sure the generative NFT collection you create lasts forever (or at least a really long time) ! Uploading images to the blockchain is very expensive since they are large in size. The best practice is to only upload the link of your image to the blockchain and store your image on an Interplanetary File System (more on that later).</p>\n<p><b>Interplanetary File System = IFS</b></p>\n<p>Pinata allows you to upload NFT images for free using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This is a distributed file-sharing system.</p>\n<h2>Other considerations</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t deepen too much the other specifications like Smart Contract, MetaMask, Minting and also where to sell your NFT collection. It exist a numerous resources on each topic. Just here are few insights about some key concepts regarding NFT.</p>\n<h3>1. Marketplaces</h3>\n<p>These marketplaces can generally be divided into two types: curated marketplaces and open marketplaces. We may bump into sites like: </p>\n<p><b>Curated marketplaces: Curated platforms only allow approved creators to mint NFTs.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foundation<br /><a href=\"https://foundation.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://foundation.app/</a></li>\n<li>SuperRare<br /><a href=\"https://superrare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://superrare.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Open marketplaces</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenSea<br /><a href=\"https://opensea.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://opensea.io/</a></li>\n<li>Rarible<br /><a href=\"https://rarible.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://rarible.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. smart contract</h3>\n<p>A smart contract is a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Its code and data reside at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are powered by smart contracts which handle the transferability and verify the ownership.You will use the ERC-721 standard. This is an   NFT standard that provides functionalities for smart contracts.</p>\n<h3>3. Minting</h3>\n<p>Minting or NFT minting is the process that transforms a digital file into a blockchain digital asset. It is impossible to modify, delete, or edit a digital asset registered on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea that have adopted a &#8220;lazy-minting&#8221; strategy. Lazy minting means that you only pay &#8220;gas fees&#8221; when a buyer purchases your NFT, meaning there is no up-front cost for creators. But, anyway, you can expect to pay something when you mint an NFT.</p>\n<p><b>The question is: &#8220;How can you evaluate this &#8220;something&#8221;?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>When you &#8220;mint&#8221; an NFT, you are changing the digital files you created into digital assets on the blockchain. How much you pay to mint your NFT collection will depend on where you choose to mint it and how much the transactions fees are associated with chosen marketplace and/or blockchain. </p>\n<p>If you decide to mint your NFT on the Ethereum network, a &#8220;gas fee&#8221; is charged to pay for the energy needed to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p>The price of &#8220;gas&#8221; can vary widely depending on the amount of traffic on the Ethereum network at the time you choose to mint your NFT. Fortunately, you can use Gas Now to track the gas prices and choose to mint your NFT at a time when the fees are low.</p>\n<p>Because gas fees have been rising with the increased traffic on the Ethereum network, some people wonder if they can mint a non-fungible token for free.</p>\n<h2>Handling NFT Python environment with anaconda</h2>\n<p>Like always with python I am handing the environment with Anaconda.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n# update conda\r\nconda update -n base -c defaults conda\r\n\r\n\r\n# create an environment with conda\r\n# Conda Environment\r\nconda create --name nft_insights python=3.9.7\r\nconda info --envs\r\nsource activate nft_insights\r\nconda deactivate\r\n# if needed to remove\r\nconda env remove -n [NAME_OF_THE_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n# command to install requirement\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n# module required\r\npip install numpy\r\npip install pillow\r\npip install streamlit\r\npip install watchdog\r\npip install python-dotenv\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b> That is fun to create your own NFTs generative collection even if the added value in aesthetics’ terms sucks but it will not prevent your collection from being the next hit on the emerging but already huge NFT market, who knows! Hurry up anyway because speculation will probably come to an end and some severe market corrections can occur at any time. Last but not least, apart from the interest, this new artistic expression seems to have a tremendous environmental impact because of all these minting operations like the rest of the internet activity by the way. So, all this can stop definitely with the environmental collapse that is the Damocles ‘sword for our physical and virtual worlds.</p>\n<h2>Videos to tackle this post</h2>\n<p>Create NFT Generative Art Collections: Using a simple NFT generator in Python<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNGvM5OHf0E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Using a simple NFT generator, made with Streamlit<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i4m2TOdjC0s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Using NFT generators with Frida Kahlo, Lionel Messi and Rosie the riveter or Pablo Picasso<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HLym1_mwCA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>The big picture</h2>\n<p><b>These attempts to create an NFT Generative Art Collections with Python is part like these 4 videos below to a workshop for the training for &#8220;Management de l’Innovation Technologique&#8221; at https://exed.polytechnique.edu/ for a project named MetaMuse.

Indeed, this is my personal answer to automate as much as possible the support to a fixed mindset users audience. Originally, this post is the result of a bundle merging 2 concerns in one: How to make efficient support? (less is more) and how to leverage on KeyBERT to make a Text Analyzer to read automatically the mails from support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The project &#8220;AUTOMATE P.O.

Feel free to modify it and do this evolution if necessary. Security, network, environment, deployment issues are complexities far beyond this POC.</li>\n<li>Again for security reason, I cannot release the real templates that I have gathered for my own usage. Instead I have populated generic template, feel free to modify and adapt to our own use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>The project leverages on these libraries.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streamlit: <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://streamlit.io/</a></li>\n<li>SQLAlchemy: <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sqlalchemy.org/</a></li>\n<li>KeyBERT: <a href=\"https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/</a></li>\n<li>SQLite: <a href=\"https://sqlite.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://sqlite.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1. Question_1: How to make efficient support?</h2>\n<p><b>My first concern is &#8220;How can I optimize the support that I currently made as a PO?&#8221;. Making support can be really exhausting! So, it is better to rely on a brainless and turn-to-key solution so you can spend less time as possible on this task.</b></p>\n<p>I know that support is a key concern but it can turn to harassment that will then change you surreptitiously into a customer support’s hater! I&#8217;m kidding but only halfway :). You must admit that sometimes making support is equivalent to provide a spare brain for people who are lazy to tackle their own difficulties&#8230; and you must be benevolent anyway!</p>\n<p>That is the application’s purpose, at least bringing me an asset in continuous learning and at the same time delegating the worst to the machine and act brainless, answering to customers should be dead simple like the blink of an eye, that&#8217;s my purpose. Making support like a robot but with all the smoothness and politeness possible.</p>\n<h2>2. Question_2: How to perform Text Analysis with Keybert?</h2>\n<p><b>My second concern was more a data science oriented issue: On user&#8217;s support feedback, how can I leverage on NLP to perform text analysis with Keybert in order to sort the user&#8217;s content by topics therefore by keywords! For that purpose, I have selected KeyBERT to explore the texts.</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>KeyBERT is a minimal and easy-to-use keyword extraction technique that leverages BERT embeddings to create keywords and keyphrases that are most similar to a document.</p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/index.html</a></i></p>\n<h2>3.

Answer_2 to Question_2: The project &#8220;KeyBERT Rough Text Analyzer&#8221;</h2>\n<p>I am not even a real data scientist nor a real developer but I am sure to know to capture the essence of some other projects and to tinker them to fit my own purposes.<br />\nSo, I have designed the application with KeyBERT based on these 2 projects. I have sample some existing application structure, in particular 2 remarkable applications: one from charlywargnier and the other from ahmedbesbes</p>\n<p>The &#8220;skeleton&#8221; for an application with KeyBERT should work with those parameters and their equivalent in Streamlit.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>st.radio :: choose your model e.g DistilBERT (Default) or Flair</li>\n<li>st.slider :: choose number of keywords/keyphrases</li>\n<li>st.number_input :: Choose Minimum Ngram</li>\n<li>st.number_input :: Choose Maximum Ngram</li>\n<li>st.checkbox :: Select Remove stop words</li>\n<li>st.checkbox :: Select Use MMR</li>\n<li>st.slider :: Keyword diversity (MMR only)</li>\n<li>st.text_area :: Paste your text below (max 500 words)</li>\n<li>st.button :: Paste your text below (max 500 words)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I intend also to use these 2 objects that are often in my Streamlit application.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\nst.expander\r\nst.help(obj)\r\n</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>BERT Keyword Extractor app<br /><a href=\"https://share.streamlit.io/charlywargnier/bert-keyword-extractor/main/app.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://share.streamlit.io/charlywargnier/bert-keyword-extractor/main/app.py</a></li>\n<li>How to extract meaningful and semantic keywords using BERT and Streamlit<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ahmedbesbes/keywords-extractor-with-bert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/ahmedbesbes/keywords-extractor-with-bert</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Focus on keyBERT: a sesame to text meaning disclosure!</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be simplistic! The basic idea is to leverage on automatic keyword generation. This principle is everywhere for multipurpose when you are dealing with texts from Chat solution to any text analysis solution. So, in my case, it will be analyze my users support&#8217;s heavy burden.</p>\n<p><b>Bert is one of the best heaviest champion in NLP! keyBERT the greatest carries, as a library, many models with among them my favorite Spacy. So, keyBERT is great for tinkering as there are tremendous number of parameters and it is embedding models such as DistilBERT or Flair. The main drawback is to know exactly what the parameters are about when you are not a specialist.</b></p>\n<p><b>Personally, I like to have results every time I am doing something! So, I use these 2 models that work for different languages (&#8216;en&#8217;, &#8216;it&#8217;, &#8216;fr&#8217;, &#8216;es&#8217;, &#8216;ru&#8217;) and give me back good-enough results in term of Keywords.</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\nLoad pretrained SentenceTransformer: distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens\r\nLoad pretrained SentenceTransformer: distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Top N results</b><br />\nYou can choose the number of results to be displayed. Between 1 and 30, the default number is 10.</p>\n<p><b>Min/Max  Ngrams</b><br />\nYou can choose the minimum and maximum values for the ngram range.<br />\nThis sets the length of the resulting keywords/keyphrases.<br />\nTo extract a set of single keywords only, set the ngram range to (1, 1)<br />\nTo extract keyphrases, set the minimum ngram value to 2. The maximum ngram value can be set to 2 or higher, depending on the number of words you would like to see in each keyphrase.</p>\n<p><b>In this post I am going to talk about N-grams, a concept found in Natural Language Processing ( aka NLP). First of all, let’s see what the term ‘N-gram’ means. Turns out that is the simplest bit, an N-gram is simply a sequence of N words. For instance, let us take a look at the following examples.</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\nSan Francisco (is a 2-gram)\r\nThe Three Musketeers (is a 3-gram)\r\nShe stood up slowly (is a 4-gram)\r\n</pre>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.xrds.acm.org/2017/10/introduction-n-grams-need/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.xrds.acm.org/2017/10/introduction-n-grams-need/</a></i></p>\n<p><b>Check Stop Words</b><br />\nThe most straightforward definition for stopwords is all the words you want to exclude from your NLP analysis.</p>\n<p>I have extended the system to not only have Stop Words in English but to other European languages such as: Italian, French, Spanish and Russian.</p>\n<p>More precisely, in any language, you have redundant words that does not bring poor insights on the text understanding. For instance, in English vocabulary, there are many words like &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;the&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; that appear very frequently in the text but they do not add any valuable information for NLP operations and modeling. These words are called stopwords and they are almost always advised to be removed as part of text preprocessing.</p>\n<p>You can add or create your own stop words list like for instance with offending words, very useful when you investigate consumer feedback in Chats or in a Forums!</p>\n<p>In my case, I have set files in a directory called stop words with stop words files found on the web for each language except english : stopwords_es.txt, stopwords_fr.txt, stopwords_it.txt, stopwords_ru.txt.</p>\n<p>For english language , as the model called is &#8220;distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens&#8221;, the stop Words list is set directly as a parameter when the model is called.</p>\n<p>You have other parameter that you should know but the best is to check directly the website. You can find much more information on the official website of KeyBERT at <a href=\"https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/</a></p>\n<p><b>Use MMR (Maximal Margin Relevance)</b><br />\nYou can use Maximal Margin Relevance (MMR) to diversify the results. It creates keywords/key phrases based on cosine similarity.</p>\n<p><b>Diversity</b><br />\nThe higher the setting, the more diverse the keywords. Note that the *Keyword diversity* slider only works if the *MMR* checkbox is ticked.</p>\n<h2>6. Final Thought: Wrap-it-up</h2>\n<p>At the end, I want to see a all-in-one. So, I decided to merge the 2 projects: &#8220;KeyBERT Rough Text Analyzer&#8221; and &#8220;AUTOMATE P.O. JOB SUPPORT&#8217;S DEMO&#8221;. Thanks to Streamlit, it has not been so difficult.

But, I have the persistent impression that the Product Owner&#8217;s job scope may probably change radically or disappear purely and simply on some aspects due to IA. In any case, as far as user support is concerned, I wish, with all my heart, to have it disappeared! Last thing, thanks again to Streamlit because by using it, I am force to think in term of GUI so it spreads good practices in terms of coding especially by refactoring the code when it is possible (DRY).</b></p>\n<h2>7.

Other remarks regarding Streamlit</H3></p>\n<p>I have noticed in most applications, made with Streamlit, resorted to upload in order to provide a source for potential analysis e.g for an EDA. Here is a quick reminder why I am not using upload feature in my Streamlit applications. For personal reasons, I&#8217;d rather like parsing CSV files than uploading it as source files. It is also because, my personal usage is to run these apps on a local computer for personal usage as a productivity tools.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start giving some simple definition both for Dataset or EDA.</p>\n<p><H3>II. Oversimplified Dataset&#8217;s definition</H3><br />\nFirst, I am oversimplifying a definition because the word &#8220;Dataset&#8221; is key. So, what is the dataset? <b>To say it simply, a dataset is a table with columns. Each of these columns has a title and contains a series of numbers vertically.</b></p>\n<p><H3>III. Did you ever heard the word EDA?</H3><br />\nEDA is to the Data Scientist what &#8220;Pan, Shovel and Pickaxe&#8221;* was to the prospector during the Gold Rush!

It is a prerequisite before submitting this same data to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Depending on the nature and amount of data you have, the exploration work can be tedious and time-consuming! You bet. This is where libraries like PANDAS PROFILING or SWEETVIZ can speed up a bit the data process and help you out to detect: outliers and anomalies, data&#8217;s quality, statistical models can fit the data&#8230; and so on.</p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/data-science/eda-in-data-science/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/data-science/eda-in-data-science</a></p>\n<p><H3>IV.

Again, I strongly invite you to read this article that is the best I have found on the web.

Like I said before I found a an in-depth article on &#8220;coderzcolumn.com&#8221; that present most of the assets that you can withdraw from a dataset with the help of SWEETVIZ.

The objective is to measure and visualize if there is a link (correlation) between the chosen column (target) and each of the columns of the table.</p>\n<p>Intuitively, because we all have a bit of a statistician in us, we almost know what is a correlation for instance. As an example, you probably know by now that there is a correlation closed to one between the probability of having lung&#8217;s cancer and cigarettes&#8217; consumption or if you do bicycle, you probably know there is a correlation between the number of head injuries and the fact of NOT wearing an helmet!<br />\nThat is being said, let&#8217;s dig into SWEETVIZ&#8230;</p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"https://data-driven-everything.com/2021/10/07/does-smoking-cause-lung-cancer-a-case-on-causation-v-s-correlation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://data-driven-everything.com/2021/10/07/does-smoking-cause-lung-cancer-a-case-on-causation-v-s-correlation/</a></p>\n<p><b>(ii) Leveraging on scikit-learn toy datasets</b><br />\nIn its great leniency, scikit-learn provides toy datasets that will be helpful to instantiate both comparisons column vs column, table vs table&#8230;</p>\n<p><b>Command to import Toy datasets provided by scikit-learn</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\nfrom sklearn import datasets\r\n</pre>\n<p>The Toy datasets used in this article like in the source are: <code>Boston house prices dataset</code> and <code>Diabetes dataset</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n    <b>EXAMPLES OF FREQUENT IA USAGES</b>\r\n    7.1.

Single Dataset Analysis</h3>\n<p><b>To understand the explanations, you should load in your browser one of these files: sweetviz_wine_report.html, sweetviz_diabetes_report.html, sweetviz_boston_report.html</b></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/streamlit-sweetviz-pandas-profiling-eda-made-easy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check 009_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py</a></b><br />\n<i>You can see the result in sweetviz_wine_report.html, sweetviz_diabetes_report.html, sweetviz_boston_report.html</i></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/streamlit-sweetviz-pandas-profiling-eda-made-easy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check 009_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py, below each line you will be able to output the report</a></b></p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# --- SCREEN_1 :: WINES ---\r\n\r\n# --- SCREEN_2 :: DIABETES ---\r\n\r\n# --- SCREEN_3 :: BOSTON ---\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>1.1 Using analyze()</b><br />\nIf you load <code>analyze()</code>. It shows some general information about the dataframe. Like any summary stats you get with the help of SWEETVIZ general informations about the dataset you want to analyze.</p>\n<p><b>1.2 Associations button</b></p>\n<p>This button is very interesting and helpful. When you click on it, you can see a correlation &#8220;heatmap&#8221; showing the correlation between all features of the dataset and only numeric features.<br />\n<b>How can read this heatmap at a glance? It has either squares or circles present in each tile. The circles represent Pearson correlation in the range [-1, 1] and so the next question is what is Pearson correlation !!?? See the point below.</b></p>\n<p><b>1.3 Pearson correlation&#8217;s most simple definition</b><br />\nHow can you interpret the correlation meaning ? What do the terms positive and negative mean? Positive correlation implies that as one variable increases as the other increases as well. Inversely, a negative correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other decreases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the Pearson correlation, see that source: <a href=\"https://datagy.io/python-pearson-correlation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://datagy.io/python-pearson-correlation/</a></li>\n<li>In order to calculate and plot a Correlation Matrix in Python and Pandas, see the source <a href=\"https://datagy.io/python-correlation-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://datagy.io/python-correlation-matrix/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>I can not say it better than the other article so here is the extended extract to give an in-depth &#8220;heatmap&#8221; interpretation.</b></p>\n<blockquote><p>The squares represent categorical associations. The categorical associations go row-wise and show how much association a feature represented by row name on left has with all other features of data. The categorical associations range from [0,1]. The heatmap will have a circle whenever showing the relation between numerical features and squares when showing the relation between categorical features or numerical and categorical features. The diagonal of the chart is left blank as each feature has a total relationship with itself. In our example, the WineType feature is categorical hence row and column representing WineType has squares whereas all other cells have circles because all other features are numerical.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>1.4 Individual Column Stats</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each dataset&#8217;s feature (column), you can access to quick summary per feature (column)&#8230; The tab has basic stats about the feature like total values, missing count, min, max, median, average, quantiles, range, standard deviation, etc.</li>\n<li>There is also an histogram showing the distribution of feature (column) data among the dataset. If you click on the tab, you get a more detailed histogram and elements about the feature (column).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Target Variable Analysis</h3>\n<p>The underlying idea is to designate a target variable (target) then to test the correlation of all the variables of the sample (dataset) with respect to this variable designated as target.</p>\n<p><b>2.1 Target Variable Details</b></p>\n<p><b>2.1.1 EXAMPLE_3 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_3_wine_df_proline_magnesium_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>This analysis is specific, the main purpose is to &#8220;skip columns &#8220;proline&#8221; and &#8220;magnesium&#8221; from original dataset and instructed to use WineType column as numerical using FeatureConfig constructor.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>2.1.2 EXAMPLE_4 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_4_wine_df_pairwise_off_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>This time, the game is to &#8220;not to include pairwise relationships between features.&#8221; As a consequence, it exclude the button &#8220;Associations&#8221;.</p>\n<p><b>2.1.3 EXAMPLE_5 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_5_diabetes_df_compare_2_datasets_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>The target variable tab is &#8220;painted in black&#8221; to differentiate it from other columns. It is handy because it will help<br />\nyou to understand &#8220;the relationship between the target variable and feature based on feature values.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>3. Compare Two datasets</h3>\n<p><b>3.1 EXAMPLE_5 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_5_diabetes_df_compare_2_datasets_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>This time is idea is to leverage on the ability of SWEETVIZ to compare two datasets. It will show a different distribution of data between two datasets.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\nreport = sweetviz.compare(source=train_df, compare=test_df, target_feat=\"Progression\")\r\nreport.show_html()\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>3.2 EXAMPLE_6 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_6_diabetes_df_compare_2_datasets_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>You can also compare train/test, train/validation, test/test and validation/test datasets. <b>So, SWEETVIZ let us generate EDA for two datasets using compare()* method. It&#8217;ll show EDA for datasets next to each other.</b></p>\n<p><b>The idea is to divide the diabetes dataset into train (80%) and test (20%) sets using scikit-learn&#8217;s train_test_split() method and then it will compare these two datasets.</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\nreport = sweetviz.compare(source=[train_df,\"Train Set\"], compare=[test_df, \"Validation Set\"], target_feat=\"Progression\")\r\nreport.show_html()\r\n</pre>\n<h3>4. Divide Dataset using boolean variable and Compare them</h3>\n<p><b>4.1 EXAMPLE_7 in 010_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.py. You can see the result in example_7_boston_df_compare_2_datasets_streamlit_webapp_sweetviz.html</b></p>\n<p>It is sometimes useful to understand more deeply the dataset and especially used a boolean column of dataset. For instance, to make comparison to see EDA for all rows with gender male v/s all rows with gender female.</p>\n<p>For a newbie like me, it sounds close to categorical variables that are used in Categorical Summary. These variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups. Examples of categorical variables are race, sex, age group, and educational level to produce Categorical Summary</p>\n<p>You can then change the method and perform different comparison EDA.<br />\nFor instance, that is the purpose used for the EDA with the Boston housing dataset. The CHAS variable inside of the Boston hosing dataset has boolean information about whether houses are on the bounds of a river or not. </p>\n<p>Then, it will be possible with the compare_intra() to divide into two datasets based on boolean values of column CHAS and generate EDA comparing those two datasets.</p>\n<p><i>For the record, CHAS is &#8220;Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)</i></p>\n<p><b>All these methods have a unique purpose to generate easily reports in HTML quickly and with relevant key indicators on any type of dataset. For sure, SWEETVIZ do the job greatly! That is one of the best tool for EDA generation.</b></p>\n<p><H3>VII. EDA made with a Class (streamlit_eda_made_easy_1)</H3><br />\nOn GitHub, you can find different approach to build up an EDA.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>So, my objective was to build a dashboard with Streamlit that automate Screaming Frog SEO Spider for large time saves and fast audits then manage the output (csv reports), save it into a SQLite database and analyse it with creating graphics. <b>You can find all the code on my github account at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3oAPuBP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3oAPuBP</a></b></p>\n<h2>I. SEO POC</h2>\n<h3>1. Methodology</h3>\n<p>Like always I am heading for a POC (Proof of Concept). So, pragmatism over theory. POC does not have to be perfect or compliant to some coding best practices or even logical at some point! The real value occurs often during the POC in some low noise signals, so be open minded and listen&#8230; As it is said &#8220;Knowledge speaks, Wisdom listens&#8221;. <b>In this exploration phase, the purpose remains to achieve a fixed goal in a limited amount of time, avoiding spending 2 years for instance on a POC! 🙂 That&#8217;s it for the methodology.</b></p>\n<h3>2. Value</h3>\n<p>As a PO, sometime for website, I need to have an eye on SEO KPIs. Even so, I am far from being a specialist, I need to grab and quickly overview key indicators (kinda a PO data-science oriented) and henceforth gather SEO best practices to fine-tune the website eventually.<br />\n<b>But, as far as possible, it has to be made by a &#8220;tool&#8221; that ease these processes so it should be industrialized and automatized. The background idea is always to chain actions between them in order to improve productivity and facilitate decision-making. That&#8217;s it for the value proposal. Just remember that learning has a cost and experimental work is expensive! So, Timeboxing exploration is a duty!</b></p>\n<h3>3. Individual</h3>\n<p>What about my objectives me as an individual, they are several:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delegate tedious work to machines in order to give me more free time</li>\n<li>Improving my Python&#8217;s practice</li>\n<li>Give a more data-science flavor to my resume to become a mixed flavored data-science PO for digital! By the way, for me, Streamlit has solved this paradox between investing on web or data-science. With Streamlit I can do both: (1) IA or Machine learning web tools or (2) handy Web Tools for other dedicated job&#8217;s purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>This POC is definitely in the second category. That&#8217;s it for my personal investment. As a first conclusion, I will say that any POC is a always a good tradeoffs between personal and professional objectives.</b></p>\n<h3>4. Sources</h3>\n<p>This post has been also inspired by these 2 posts but I believe I have taken in a more personal direction the challenge exposed in these 2 posts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An SEO guide for automating Screaming Frog with Python<br /><a href=\"https://www.rocketclicks.com/client-education/an-seo-guide-for-automating-screaming-frog-with-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.rocketclicks.com/client-education/an-seo-guide-for-automating-screaming-frog-with-python/</a>\n    </li>\n<li>Badass SEO: Automate Screaming Frog For Large Time Saves and Fast Audits<br /><a href=\"https://cometfuel.com/learn/automate-screaming-frog/#using-terminal-mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://cometfuel.com/learn/automate-screaming-frog/#using-terminal-mac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I quote this post cause I need to remember it, about the inadequacies sometimes between tech and reality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe first job of an application architect is to &#8220;right size&#8221; the business or enterprise with the most efficient technology for their use case; not just saddle them with your pet preferences because it&#8217;s the latest &#8220;fad-tech&#8221; from Google or it’s what they taught you in school.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://beau-beauchamp.medium.com/php-is-killing-python-2be459364284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://beau-beauchamp.medium.com/php-is-killing-python-2be459364284</a></p>\n<h2>II. Build up the app (the POC)</h2>\n<p>Ok let&#8217;s build our dashboard! Like many softwares, Screaming Frog SEO Spider offers the ability to run without User Interface via Command line. With help of Streamlit, you can build your own webapp (GUI) to industrialize, automate repetitive tasks then transform raw data into useful information. That is my objective.</p>\n<h3>1. Guidelines</h3>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s build this GUI with these few simple guidelines defined earlier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Streamlit</b> library will be the &#8220;wrapper&#8221; for our application. (<a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://streamlit.io/</a>)</li>\n<li><b>SQLite</b> will be used as database. I gave up completely MySQL as SQLite is a serverless database. It gives more flexibility to implement a database behind an app, that is the main reason why SQLite is often used in mobile development. (<a href=\"https://sqlite.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://sqlite.org</a>)</li>\n<li><b>SQLAlchemy</b> will be use to query the database to offer again flexibility and minimize the written code in Python. Thanks to this abstraction (ORM), it is possible to connect to a large number of databases (Firebird, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Sybase) and above all to standardize and considerably minimize your code in order to make it readable by other people and finally reusable. That&#8217;s savvy! (<a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sqlalchemy.org/</a>)</li>\n<li><b>Screaming Frog SEO Spider</b> is a website crawler that helps you improve onsite SEO. (<a href=\"https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Behind all these technical recommendations, there are few key ideas that again should be exposed because these ideas have also prevailed in this POC.</b></p>\n<h3>2. Few more ideas</h3>\n<p><b>2.1 praise for simplicity</b><br />\nAs a PO, you might suffer from the information and tools dissemination that prevent you from having a big picture of your products. So handling everything in the same screen helps to minimize information&#8217;s confusion. It should be the target of any monitoring application. I will call it praise for simplicity.<br />\n<b>For an application, think to centralize and to minify the info, never unnecessarily expand it. That&#8217;s a waste of time for user.</b></p>\n<p><b>2.2 use cases decision matrix</b><br />\nAlways think of the most extreme use cases and the non-user use cases for your web application. It will force you to<br />\nlook beyond the objective and look for the most attractive use cases. That is also a practical strategy to shorten the exploration phase to look for attractive use cases in order to save time on the primary exploration phase.<br />\n<b>What the purpose of building an application that won&#8217;t be use ?</b></p>\n<p><b>2.3 code prospecting for usages</b><br />\nCapture the most possible information about similar existing web application like the one you want to create. For<br />\ninstance, browsing through Git to grab some code you will prevent you from reinventing the wheel. <b>That&#8217;s a usages benchmark that can be withdrawn from existing codes.</b></p>\n<p><b>2.4 collect user feedback first then analyse</b><br />\nLike for any data science project, try to collect the data yourself by mingling with other users than you. One advice if looking user feedback, be sure to record everything of their responses. While you are listening, your bandwidth is very low and it is almost impossible to detect the relevant vs the irrelevant in their feedback. You will make analysis it but later!</p>\n<h3>3. The DB: using SQLITE</h3>\n<p>Instead of MySQL, I am using SQLITE and like I said before: it is easier to implement but the syntax slightly differs from MySQL.</p>\n<p><b>3.1 Advices</b><br />\nYou can name your database with both extension <code>.sqlite3</code> or <code>.db</code><br />\ne.g. streamlit_sqlalchemy_example.sqlite3 or streamlit_sqlalchemy_example.db</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# name of your database\r\nengine = create_engine(\r\n        'sqlite:///data/streamlit_sqlalchemy_example.sqlite3')\r\n</pre>\n<p>A good practice is to put the db file in a directory then you find it easily e.g. data is my directory name for db<br />\nfiles.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# Valid SQLite URL forms are:\r\nsqlite:///:memory: (or, sqlite://)\r\nsqlite:///relative/path/to/file.db\r\nsqlite:////absolute/path/to/file.db\r\n</pre>\n<p>2 important lines to stress how to connect, for the rest, you can check the files available on my github account.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# this line create the empty tables\r\n    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\r\n\r\n# it imports the table that you need e.g Products\r\nfrom streamlit_sqlalchemy_database import Products\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>3.2 SQLite command reminder</b><br />\nSome useful commands for SQLite</p>\n<pre lang=\"sql\">\r\n# to get into SQLITE3, just type the command sqlite3 in the console\r\nsqlite3\r\n\r\n#.open /your-path/source.db\r\n# open a connection extension can be .db\r\n.open /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/python-automate-screaming-frog/data/screamingfrog_websites_crawls_all.db\r\n\r\n# open a connection extension can be .sqlite3\r\n.open /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/python-automate-screaming-frog/streamlit_sqlalchemy_example/data/screamingfrog_websites_crawls_all_new_1.sqlite3\r\n\r\n# show tables\r\n.tables\r\n\r\n\r\n# make a dump\r\n.output /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/python-automate-screaming-frog/sqlite_source_dump_2.sql\r\n.dump\r\n\r\n\r\n# read dump\r\n.read /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/python-automate-screaming-frog/sqlite_source_dump_2.sql\r\n\r\n\r\n- command\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM websites;\r\nSELECT * FROM websites;\r\n\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM crawls;\r\nSELECT * FROM crawls;\r\n\r\n- delete tables\r\nDROP TABLE websites;\r\nDROP TABLE crawls;\r\n\r\n\r\n- delete\r\n# DELETE FROM table_name;\r\nDELETE FROM websites;\r\nVACUUM;\r\n</pre>\n<h3>4. Describing Wireframe Screens</h3>\n<p><b>My app project is divided in 4 main screens and here is the navigation chosen below:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>screen_1 :: General</li>\n<li>screen_2 :: Crawl</li>\n<li>screen_3 :: Parse and Insert</li>\n<li>screen_4 :: Analyze</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Making a Wireframe, in addition to being time consuming, also presents the disadvantage that you must define different screen status every time the user is<br />\nhitting a button! Honestly, it is obvious that the screens resemblance between the Wireframe and the real application mitigate this step interest. <b>In a way, design screens for your web-application is useless as Streamlit is so quick to build up the screens itself.</b> </p>\n<p><b>To illustrate this non-interest, I put side by side Wireframe (made quickly with Balsamiq) and the real app (made quickly also with Streamlit). The only thing that may have a real interest is to summarize for each screen, with simple words, the User Experience expected like a User Story. I know Graphic Designers or UX Designers may hate me for this. Below my app User Stories.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>navigation :: As a user, I can select<br />\n            destination in a main navigation dropdown menu on the left.</li>\n<li>screen_1 :: General :: As a user, I can add into the database a website (title, url) to be crawled later.</li>\n<li>screen_2 :: Crawl :: As a user, I can launch the crawl with Screaming Frog by selecting a website in a drop-down menu. By clicking on a button to launch the crawl, it will be print out the Screaming Frog command-line and executed it.</li>\n<li>screen_3 :: Parse and Insert :: As a user, I can parse Screaming Frog&#8217;s CVS &#8220;reports&#8221; directory, select a file and launch computation then insert data into the SQLite database.</li>\n<li>screen_4 :: Analyze :: As a user, I can load graphics that analyzed Screaming Frog&#8217;s SEO KPIs taken from the SQLite database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>(Screen_1) General</b></p>\n<p><i>Wireframe (Balsamiq)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_1_general_balsamiq.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_1_general_balsamiq.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><i>Real app (Streamlit)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_1_general_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\"\n    data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_1_general_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><b>(Screen_2) Crawl</b></p>\n<p><i>Wireframe (Balsamiq)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_2_crawl_balsamiq.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_2_crawl_balsamiq.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><i>Real app (Streamlit)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_2_crawl_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_2_crawl_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" alt=\"\"\n    width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><b>(Screen_3) Parse and Insert</b></p>\n<p><i>Wireframe (Balsamiq)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_3_parse_insert_balsamiq.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_3_parse_insert_balsamiq.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><i>Real app (Streamlit)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_3_parse_insert_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_3_parse_insert_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" alt=\"\"\n    width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><b>(Screen_4) Analyze</b></p>\n<p><i>Wireframe (Balsamiq)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_4_analyse_balsamiq.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_4_analyse_balsamiq.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><i>Real app (Streamlit)</i><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_4_analyze_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" data-src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen_4_analyze_streamlit_screaming_frog.png\" alt=\"\"\n    width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<h3>5. Create alias for your favorite application in the MAC console</h3>\n<p><b>I love todo-list because I always forget how to do things. It is nice to have somewhere a little helping note that shed some light on actions that you seldom do. That is the purpose of the lines below even.</b></p>\n<p>So, in order to simplify the command-line, I made a alias to be able to call screaming frog application with the alias<br />\n<code>froggy</code>.

I must admit that learning recent web technologies bring me closer than ever to the &#8220;serious&#8221; software industry than I thought. I should say it the other way round that is more the Software Industry that shifts to SaaS, Cloud and web technologies since 20 years from now&#8230;. <b>after all any website is nothing more than a &#8220;software&#8221; running in a browser.</b></li>\n<li><b>It reinforces me as a user centric PO and shapes me as an &#8220;improver&#8221;, &#8220;tinker&#8221; or &#8220;builder&#8221; for added value tools to improve daily processes and focus on delivering quickly real value!

      "rendered": "<p>How to streamline as much as possible an application building process from conception to sharing&#8230; I am definitely addicted to Streamlit. So, for the coming months, I believe that Streamlit will be on top of any simple web-application that I will build for my own use both for Machine Learning webapps or for simple &#8220;facilitation&#8221; that how I call the webapps devoted to automation, visualization or data exploration! </p>\n<p><b>Tired of reading a post, you can find the code and the videos directly on my GitHub account at the URLs below:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-with-heroku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-with-heroku</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, to speak, as a PO, I have learned awkwardly but surely how to forge my own tools with this stated objective: delegate most of my work to computers, truly. That is the main motivation to learn computer language like Python. Especially learning Python gives access to a tremendous number of extended data-science features that seems to be unreachable in other language like PHP for instance. Indeed, for the last months, tooling has been my real job! On one hand, I am patiently adding new skills to my resume and the other hand, it jeopardizes some of the tools I am working on professionally. Let’s speak frankly, if these tools cannot aggregate new functionalities e.g. data visualization, NLP features for instance… They are doomed to disappear or me at least to stop working on it!</p>\n<p>That is the reason why I have the lingering impression that continue to learn PHP, WordPress or even a framework like Symfony is like beating a dead horse&#8230; But, this is just my opinion.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get back on more basic question. First of all, as a user I need to be able to develop and then deploy locally and sometimes remotely these future tools, so they become sharable. You can even think about using Docker but I will focus only on 2 existing hosting platforms: Heroku and Streamlit itself. One thing at a time.</p>\n<p><b>If you are interested by using Docker for your Streamlit apps, this post is a great and simple how-to.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting Started with Streamlit (Streamlit Container)<br /><a href=\"https://containds.com/desktop/tutorials/getting-started-streamlit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://containds.com/desktop/tutorials/getting-started-streamlit/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>By sharing, I mean more than just sharing the information, it is sharing the product/tool itself.</p>\n<p>Like many people, I have found that the easiest way to share a python app made with Streamlit as I have already set my sights on it are to deploy on these 2 platforms: Heroku and Streamlit as these platforms both offer hosting for free.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by deploying an app on Heroku and then on Streamlit itself.</p>\n<p><b>By the way, it was also the occasion to use directly Git in the mac console. So, let see first the requirements:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Homebrew locally and make it accessible through the Mac console (Free) at <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://brew.sh/</a></li>\n<li>Install Git locally and make it accessible through the Mac console (Free) at <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/download/mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://git-scm.com/download/mac</a></li>\n<li>Create an account on Github (Free) at  <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/</a>\n<li>Create an account on Heroku (Free) at  <a href=\"https://signup.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://signup.heroku.com/</a></li>\n<li>Create an account on Streamlit (Free) at  <a href=\"https://share.streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://share.streamlit.io/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>First of all, it requires an account on Heroku, streamlit and Github. All these platforms are free so you can subscribe without fees. Just to let you know, there is a limitation both for in the app number and in the app build attempts. It requires also Git and Heroku CLI.</p>\n<p><b>To install Git with homebrew</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n\r\n# It supposed that Homebrew is already installed on your computer. \r\n# https://brew.sh/\r\n# to launch the Homebrew install, you can run the following command\r\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n# It supposed that Git is already installed on your computer. \r\n# Launch the install with homebrew\r\nbrew install git\r\n\r\n# Check in the console with this command\r\ngit --version\r\n# If Git is not installed, please do install it whith homebrew\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<h2>1. Deploying streamlit application on Heroku platform</h2>\n<p>In this step you&#8217;ll install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). You use the CLI to manage and scale your applications, provision add-ons, view your application logs, and run your application locally.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n# install Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)\r\nbrew doctor \r\nbrew update\r\nbrew install heroku/brew/heroku\r\nheroku autocomplete\r\n\r\n# Check in the console with this command\r\nheroku --version\r\n# https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completions\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>So, you are ready to deploy on Heroku, you just have to create an Streamlit app on a GitHub repository that part is explained in the video below and the readme is available on my GitHub account.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-with-heroku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-with-heroku</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Deploying streamlit application on Streamlit platform</h2>\n<p>Same workflow to deploy on Streamlit and same limitations for free account, you are limited in the number of applications you can deploy.</p>\n<p><b>You will leverage on the same environment: git, GitHub repository for the Streamlit code. This part is also explained in the video below and the readme is available on my GitHub account.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Videos</h2>\n<p><b>If you want to see videos instead of reading a post, I have released 5 videos that explain what I intend to do. As Richard Feynman said &#8220;If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221; that what prevailed during the videos creation.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video #1 Part 1 &#8211; Streamlit application requirements and installation<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_n5BO-zrAI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>\n<li>Video #2 Part 2 &#8211; Install modules in your development environment and launch the Streamlit application<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ul2wQm8N2-M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>\n<li>Video #3 Part 3 &#8211; Using Git in the Mac Console to update your Streamlit application<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXlMrGcPEN4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>\n<li>Video #4 Part 4 &#8211; Connect to Heroku with Heroku CLI &#038; deploy your Streamlit application<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_f-WoLYTxs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>\n<li>Video #5 Part 5 &#8211; All-in-one on deploying your Streamlit application on Streamlit&#8217;s platform<br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Py8yAUbVwcc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><b>I guess a mix of shared app and an extensive Docker usage if needed can be a great hybrid solution to forge and share your own tools. The downside is that it requires a large amount of time as it is a time-consuming investigation as a PO to manage tools such as Docker, Git&#8230; etc. The return on time invested is worth as:<br />\n&#8211; It may save time later in your PO function<br />\n&#8211; It make also you resume more appealing (I will not dare to say sexy) as you show some interest for technologies that already shape your work. What I called the &#8220;follow the cash&#8221; method.</b></p>\n<h2>More infos</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How to Share Streamlit Apps Securely with Clients<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/sharing-streamlit-apps-securely-with-your-clients-a34bf0f9e00c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/sharing-streamlit-apps-securely-with-your-clients-a34bf0f9e00c</a></li>\n<li>Turn An Excel Sheet Into An Interactive Dashboard Using Python (Streamlit)<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0A9i6d320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0A9i6d320</a></li>\n<li>Python &#038; VBA, Become an Office Superhero<br /><a href=\"https://pythonandvba.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://pythonandvba.com/</a></li>\n<li>The Sven-Bo github account who is behind Python &#038; VBA<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/Sven-Bo?tab=repositories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/Sven-Bo?tab=repositories</a></li>\n<li>Deploying a Simple Streamlit app using Docker<br /><a href=\"https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-deploy-streamlit-app-with-docker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-deploy-streamlit-app-with-docker/</a></li>\n<li>How to Deploy Streamlit Apps with Docker<br /><a href=\"https://blog.jcharistech.com/2020/01/08/how-to-deploy-streamlit-apps-with-docker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.jcharistech.com/2020/01/08/how-to-deploy-streamlit-apps-with-docker/</a></li>\n<li>Run Streamlit With Docker and Docker-Compose<br /><a href=\"https://dev.to/sophiabrandt/run-streamlit-with-docker-and-docker-compose-15d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dev.to/sophiabrandt/run-streamlit-with-docker-and-docker-compose-15d</a></li>\n<li>Use a Different Volume For Your Docker Images in Ubuntu<br /><a href=\"https://medium.com/clusterfk/use-a-different-volume-for-your-docker-images-in-ubuntu-4c0315be6d66\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/clusterfk/use-a-different-volume-for-your-docker-images-in-ubuntu-4c0315be6d66<br />\n</a></li>\n<li>Making Docker, Conda and Jupyter play well together<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/making-docker-and-conda-play-well-together-eda0ff995e3c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/making-docker-and-conda-play-well-together-eda0ff995e3c</a></li>\n<li>Install Docker Desktop on Mac<br /><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

By the way, that is also one of the main advantage of the agile method with the Sprint concept, setting a time limit. As a consequence, empiricism and action has always my favor on theory. For sure, in digital, remaining theorical is sometimes to stay in a comfort zone with neither validation nor invalidation from the battlefield. That is a way to grow the virus of inaction that lead to impotence! Wow&#8230; sounds angry 🙂 No, let’s say, I am more weary, weary of chilly people exhausting you with formal prerequisites that will never be satisfied. I believe that these so-called prerequisites mostly reveal fear for uncertainty! But, once for all, let&#8217;s take it for granted: the place of the unforeseen cannot be eliminated. Human actions and thought are always stricken with incompleteness! That being said, it is also wised not to act without thinking, even though your thoughts are confused.</p>\n<p><b>You can find the code on my github account:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extending Streamlit usage: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/extending_streamlit_usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/extending_streamlit_usage</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>You can watch the videos related to this article:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDd5QyVJIO0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part 1 Extending Streamlit Usage &#8211; Discovering and using Python with SQlite through the console and with sqlitebrowser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyLvMEmcVwo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part 2 Extending Streamlit Usage &#8211; Create a CRUD countries manager with Streamlit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qmKQ1nlIoA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part 3 Extending Streamlit Usage &#8211; Using Streamlit as a Wireframing Tool</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That is exactly my situation, by learning python, I do not know what exactly I am looking for in the first place but discovering Streamlit step by step has become a win-win game where: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I deepen my knowledge and practices of Python for real purpose.</li>\n<li>I explore possibilities of Datascience and ML.</li>\n<li>And create a whole series of web applications sometimes far beyond the data science perimeter!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Indeed, for my own work, as an autodidact in computer science, I do not respect any constraints except my imagination!

Anything that streamline my tasks both dull or absorbing work by processing it with a creative turn-to-key tools build on top of Streamlit is welcome! With Streamlit, I may have found the &#8220;Graal&#8221; and the Sky seems to be the limit!</li>\n<li><b>Streamlit as a Wireframing Tool:</b> I am definitly a Wireframing fanatic! As a PO, I always try create a &#8220;user experience cinematic&#8221; to explain the feature that I want to be developed. To do this, I use numerous software such as Balsamiq, OmniGraffle, Axure&#8230; and release sometime movies out of it to show and explain as much as possible what I want. In a way, reading my tickets in Jira is more like going to the movie. In the future, I may straighly leverage on Streamlit to expose what I want in terms of UX. Building directly the app replace a real sketch. This might help me to remove all the unnecessary, annoying or confusing elements that detract developpers. Streamlit will provide me &#8220;UX fat-free&#8221; app&#8230;</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing Submit button and Forms &#x1f4c3;<br /><a href=\"https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-submit-button-and-forms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-submit-button-and-forms/</a></li>\n<li>Designing Streamlit Apps for the User<br /><a href=\"https://blog.streamlit.io/designing-streamlit-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blog.streamlit.io/designing-streamlit-apps/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><b>Using Streamlit and SQLite for bigger amount of Data:</b> Replacing CSV and using the most used database engine in the world can be practical.

Like anyone who start something new like I do now with Python and IA, I am currently in the &#8220;enthusiastic phase&#8221; that tend to transmogrify me as an overzealous supporter like cucumbers are ultimately transmogrified into pickles!</p>\n<p><b>You can find the code on my github account:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring Streamlit: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/build_interactive_webapps_python_scripts_using_streamlit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build_interactive_webapps_python_scripts_using_streamlit</a></li>\n<li>Exploring Dash: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/build_interactive_webapps_python_scripts_using_dash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build_interactive_webapps_python_scripts_using_dash</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>You can also watch the videos:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCmL4YMQ_rs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part 1 &#8211; Exploring Streamlit or Dash to build specific Interactive Web Applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swiHcsVTxGo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Part 2 &#8211; Exploring Streamlit or Dash to build specific Interactive Web Applications</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Anyway, this learning process is not without consequences, it definitely calls into question my PO&#8217;s practices, habits and skills. Am I a conservative with a fixed mindset ? Or do I accept changes as necessary and essential even though it may say leaving my comfort zone to a more exploratory area! It is almost a cliché dilemma!</b></p>\n<p>I know that all technologies are doomed to disappear or to be replaced. Regarding Python&#8217;s potential, the question has<br />\nbecome more and more acute &#8220;Will I be, from 1 or 2 years from now, an has-been P.O, knowing only deprecated technology if I do not tackle right now the Python/AI/ML revolution?&#8221;. I guess I will answer YES.</p>\n<p>By experience, I know also that it is not a direct threat but a progressive one. I heard that meanwhile Python is<br />\nsteadily progressing, PHP for instance remains popular mostly<br />\ndue to the 2 killer apps named WordPress and Drupal, legacy! Even though, there are some smoke screen effects due to local exceptions e.g. French development labour market dominated<br />\nby Symfony for instance or the worldwide Laravel spectacular breakthrough. </p>\n<p>I do not know if It can be considered as a forerunner sign for the actual or future Python hegemony but just google for instance the result number on<br />\nManichean comparisons such as &#8220;PHP vs Python&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be surprised!</p>\n<p>Lastly, here is 2 videos, that are addressing this concern on this future trend. The first video is in brazilian, a quite personal testimony but it remains interesting both for practising brazilian and hearing few arguments. The second video gives a very macro vision and quite technical but with a huge historical depth and that&#8217;s quite interesting even though a bit technical.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP vale a pena? (minha opinião sincera) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H43fXodv6WY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H43fXodv6WY</a></li>\n<li>Why Isn&#8217;t Functional Programming the Norm? – Richard Feldman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After, the few thoughts, let&#8217;s get down to earth!</p>\n<p>Professionally, I am a bit utilitarian. Learning something new like Python and IA has to &#8220;payback&#8221; somehow. I always try to figure out what can I gain from this experience and how can I apply this knowledge on a daily basis before starting up. Sometimes it even turns ridiculous! I must also confess that I didn&#8217;t go that far as the guy behind keypressingmonkey*. </p>\n<p><i>See <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/everything-i-automated-in-2020-to-save-me-hours-of-time-14510a1a17d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everything I Automated In 2020 To Save Me Hours Of Time</a> by <a href=\"https://keypressingmonkey.medium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://keypressingmonkey.medium.com/</a>. There is also this very truthful testimony about learning coding in <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/i-learned-coding-mostly-from-porn-471da75ea763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I Learned Coding Mostly From Porn</a></i></p>\n<p>In the meantime, I always deal with these 2 safeguards: obsolescence and time-to-market.These 2 concepts can be sumarized with 1 question: &#8220;Is there a purpose to learn something that will be soon deprecated?&#8221;. Despite all this questioning, I preserve to learn Python/AI/ML. As a conclusion, what I am looking for in term of feature may require to drop PHP as the only main programming language and turn my known developing paradigm upside down.</p>\n<p>So, that is the reason why I have explored especially the ability with Python to build-up quickly applications, leveraging on these 2 python libraries :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streamlit <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://streamlit.io/</a></li>\n<li>Plotly Dash <a href=\"https://dash.plotly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><br />\n    https://dash.plotly.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This post is my feedback on this experience. Enough conceptual bullshit! Let&#8217;s get straight to the point with examples. </p>\n<p><b>My idea is to build a Dashboard in Python, quickly and on-demand, with an existing framework such as Plotly Dash or Streamlit to address a specific need. So, it suppose that you are able to quickly perform the following tasks:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leveraging intensively on a low-code with library like Streamlit or Plotly Dash</li>\n<li>Quickly and gently retrieving and consolidating heterogeneous data from different sources : mysql dump, csv, pickle, static json file, WP API&#8230;</li>\n<li>Focusing on a very SPA (Single Page Application) approach, respecting the single idea rule: one need, one feature, one screen, one application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>In this exploratory phase, shoddy work is even acceptable so you can focus on feature and value and not on development! But by choosing such a library, it is also picking a great foundation on which you can build any of your application with a relative good manufacturing quality.</i></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s browse some examples.</p>\n<h2>1. Streamlit</h2>\n<p>It is truly the ultimate Plug and Play tool for forging an application in data science. Once the installation is done! Creating an app is almost immediate and you obtain a rather conclusive result especially liked with few other libraries (Pandas, Spacy).</p>\n<p><b>You can check the files from my github account.</b></p>\n<p><b>In comment, in each file, how to launch the python script and the source.</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\n\"\"\"\r\n[path]\r\ncd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/build_interactive_webapps_python_scripts_using_streamlit/02_interactive_webapps_streamlit/\r\n\r\n[file]\r\nstreamlit run 001_interactive_webapps_streamlit_pandas.py\r\n\r\n\r\n# more on infos and apps on\r\nhttps://streamlit.io/\r\nhttps://streamlit.io/gallery\r\nhttps://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\n# Source :: !

Dash</h2>\n<p>To me, Dash is closer to Flask. So, it is closer to a small, lightweight Python web framework to create a website. Still, I have gathered few examples that enable a comparison with Streamlit. There are very convincing examples if you need to prototype quickly a web application.</p>\n<p>Definitely, Dash enables you to make great things but the learning curb is much steep and it sounds more like learning a way to create real websites with all the issues, especially nice UX for your IHM.</p>\n<p><b>Nevertheless, I selected 2 impressive projects that show Dash extraordinary potential. It is sure that it can be a strong alternative to a PHP framework like Symfony or Laravel to create an in-house CMS like the one I am dealing with for instance as it integrates like a charm Data Science features.</b></p>\n<p><i>Files examples from my github account</i></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n001_plotly_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n002_plotly_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n003_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n003_plotly_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n004_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n005_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n006_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n007_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n008_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n009_interactive_webapps_dash.py\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>The 2 great projects that leverage on Dash:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<!-- interactive_webapps_dash_nlp_project_1 --></p>\n<li>Project #1: NLP visualizations for clear, immediate insights into text data and outputs<br /><a href=\"https://medium.com/plotly/nlp-visualisations-for-clear-immediate-insights-into-text-data-and-outputs-9ebfab168d5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/plotly/nlp-visualisations-for-clear-immediate-insights-into-text-data-and-outputs-9ebfab168d5b</a></li>\n<p><!-- interactive_webapps_dash_nlp_project_2 --></p>\n<li> Project #2: NLP visualizations for clear, immediate insights into text data and outputs<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/giancarlotorres22/nlp-projeto-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/giancarlotorres22/nlp-projeto-2/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b><br />\nRegarding what I was looking for, I&#8217;d rather go with Streamlit. That is great tool to extend life to some of my python scripts transforming them into an application that is sharable with anyone including customers. The existence of a Framework like Streamlit greatly facilitates the design and creation of a web application. It makes a serious alternative to all frameworks and already appeals to more than one team or PO. Obviously, this is not just a fad as it might have been in its days RoR for instance.</p>\n<h2>More infos</h2>\n<ul>\n<p><H3>Streamlit</H3></p>\n<li>Streamlit &#8211; The fastest way to build and

So, it often happens that I am writing code for my own use to avoid tedious work or even the work itself!</p>\n<p>I am currently working on Python and try to sneak out practical results quickly with the help of ML, NLP or IA. As I read a lot of stuff about IA, I incidentally discovered Ludwig! So, this post is my personal tchotchkes&#8217; collection on Ludwig. </p>\n<p>My feeling was that the more I was reading about Ludwig, the more it maybe the right tool for me! Curiosity for IA but laziness and reluctancy for theoretical explanations and coding. Anyway, enough pointless personal considerations, let&#8217;s introduce Ludwig and then use it to train, predict and visualize!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>All the files shown in the 3 videos can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_ludwig_introduction_to_deep_learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_ludwig_introduction_to_deep_learning</a></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1. What is Ludwig? </h3>\n<p><b>Ludwig is a code free deep-learning tool box</b>. It is supported by a Uber research scientist named Piero Molino. Ludwig lets people without a machine learning background train prediction models without the need to write code. </p>\n<p>Ludwig can help you make deep learning easier to understand for non-experts and enable faster model improvement iteration cycles for experienced machine learning developers and researchers alike. </p>\n<p>Ludwig is a good starting to cover many ML use cases. It has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>flexibility:</b> expert users and novices can take advantage of Ludwig.</li>\n<li><b>extensibility:</b> really easy to add additional model to Ludwig.<b></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ludwig make the model understandable at least in terms of what is predicting and what is the quality of the predictions.</p>\n<p>It streamlines the ML process and assists you in all the workflow: splits the data in training, validation, and test sets, trains the model on the training set, validates on the validation set (early stopping), predicts on the test set&#8230; and so on.</p>\n<p>You really have only set the output feature and the input feature and define the data type abstraction or a model definition without coding because it is all in .yml file.</p>\n<p><b>The real issue that you may encounter is really to understand what you are currently doing if you are not familiar with ML. Like me, in the past, I have mostly used pretrained models so I am not aware of all the model’s subtleties and the way to fine tune a model! What a schmock!</b></p>\n<p>There are plenty of examples on the official documentation at <a href=\"https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/</a></p>\n<h3>2. Install LUDWIG</h3>\n<p>Ludwig requires you to use Python 3.6+. If you don&#8217;t have Python 3 installed, install it by running:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\nsudo apt install python3  # on ubuntu\r\nbrew install python3      # on mac\r\n</pre>\n<p>You may want to use a virtual environment to maintain an isolated Python environment.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\nvirtualenv -p python3 venv\r\n</pre>\n<p>In order to install Ludwig just run:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\npip install ludwig\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Check LUDWIG Installation</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\nludwig -h\r\n</pre>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n# OUTPUT\r\n\r\n-h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\nludwig cli runner\r\nludwig --help or ludwig -h\r\n\r\nAvailable sub-commands:\r\n   train                 Trains a model\r\n   predict               Predicts using a pretrained model\r\n   evaluate              Evaluate a pretrained model's performance\r\n   experiment            Runs a full experiment training a model and evaluating it\r\n   hyperopt              Perform hyperparameter optimization\r\n   serve                 Serves a pretrained model\r\n   visualize             Visualizes experimental results\r\n   collect_summary       Prints names of weights and layers activations to use with other collect commands\r\n   collect_weights       Collects tensors containing a pretrained model weights\r\n   collect_activations   Collects tensors for each datapoint using a pretrained model\r\n   export_savedmodel     Exports Ludwig models to SavedModel\r\n   export_neuropod       Exports Ludwig models to Neuropod\r\n   preprocess            Preprocess data and saves it into HDF5 and JSON format\r\n   synthesize_dataset    Creates synthetic data for tesing purposes\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>If it is all done! You are good, you are ready to go and be part of the IA revolution and add some wow to your professional life at least.</b></p>\n<h3>3. Using LUDWIG</h3>\n<p>Here is a quick memo on important notions that you may often encounter if you get to grip with AI or Deep learning.</p>\n<p><b>3.1 Few definitions: epoch, batch, dataset&#8230;</b><br />\n<b>That an extract of the most simple answer about &#8220;What is an epoch?&#8221; extracted from <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-epoch-in-deep-learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-epoch-in-deep-learning</a></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deep learning often deals with copious amounts of data.</li>\n<li>This data is broken down into smaller chunks (called <b>batches</b>) and fed to the neural networks one-by-one.</li>\n<li>One <b>epoch</b> is when the entire <b>dataset</b> is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.</li>\n<li>In order to generalize the model, there is more than one <b>epoch</b> in the majority of the deep learning models.</li>\n<li>The more the number of <b>epochs</b>, the more the parameters are adjusted thus resulting in a better performing model. However, too many epochs might lead to <b>overfitting</b>. If a model is overfitted, it does well in the train data and performs poorly on the test data.</li>\n<li><b>Iteration</b> is the number of <b>batches</b> needed to complete one <b>epoch</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>A simple example to understand the linking between all these notions.</b><br />\nSuppose we have a dataset of 42,000 training examples and we divide it into batches of 600. To complete 1 epoch, it would have taken 70 (42,000 divided by 600) iterations.</p>\n<p><b>3.2 Must-knows on Ludwig</b></p>\n<p><b>3.2.1 requirements for ludwig, batches</b><br />\nYou do not need to code to test training models. What is required by Ludwig is input and output? Input: You need to have dataset in .csv format as an input plus a declarative model definition (YAML).</p>\n<p><b>3.2.2 Under the hood: where are the files that matters 🙂</b></p>\n<p><b>After the first training in the main folder</b><br />\nRunning Ludwig will create 2 files in the main folder: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>The file with .meta.json&#8217;s extension will contain the mapping.</li>\n<li>The file with .hdf5&#8217;s extension will contain the data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>After each training in the results folder</b><br />\n&#8211; In <code>/results/experiment_run/description.json</code>: Like it is indicated by the name, you have all the meta information about the command so the file description.json  that contains all the information on how the command was run, what was the input feature and the output feature &#8230;.</p>\n<p>&#8211; In <code>/results/experiment_run/training_statistics.json</code>: the file contains basic stats on what is accuracy, loss&#8230; etc. of your model</p>\n<p>&#8211; If you want to use model for a prediction, you just have to point to the model directory e.g <code>/results/experiment_run_3/model</code></p>\n<h3>4. EXTRAS STUFF</h3>\n<p>&#8211; You can also visualize to compare models among them with the <code>visualize</code> command.</p>\n<p>&#8211; There is also a Programmatic API that can be used directly in python script like any python library. Check <a href=\"https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/</a></p>\n<h3>5. Videos tutorials on Ludwig</h3>\n<p><b>3 videos with some little mistakes but that gave a good sense of what is Ludwig and how to use if your are not an expert!</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtlvwtOaF8M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning &#8211; How to build a text classifier with Ludwig</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAXENuxETao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning &#8211; Using a new model for a text classifier &#038; leveraging on Ludwig Programmatic API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvYjpeFOk3Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning &#8211; Predicting a passenger&#8217;s surviving probability to the Titanic disaster with Ludwig</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Well, the very first Ludwig’s benefit is psychologic! Ludwig lowers the supposed high entry barriers to concepts such as Deep learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence or Visualization. So, like me, if you are a P.O, a project manager, a marketing guy, you may feel, by discovering Ludwig, a little bit the meaning of what is the Artificial Intelligence revolution is about&#8230;<br />\nI must agree that it does not turn you magically into a data scientist in one night! The proof is that you may find explanations in my videos a bit shaky or even ludicrous.<br />\nNevertheless, that is a great opportunity to leave pre-trained models to experiment your own models. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re so small, you&#8217;re not so tall&#8221;! like the Talmud says.</p>\n<p><!-- Uberization\nCalifornization\nüber-\nMensch\nProfitability\nSchumpeter, \nI'd raher read Ludwig Wittgenstein\nUbermensch vs Untermensch\nDon't think you're so small you're not so tall\n--></p>\n<p><!-- \nrosy_render_play_youtube_like_585x330\nusing_ludwig_introduction_to_Deep_Learning\nUsing Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning\n--></p>\n<h2>More infos</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ludwig Examples<br /><a href=\"https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/</a></li>\n<li>ludwig-ai on Github<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/</a></li>\n<li>Introducing Ludwig, a Code-Free Deep Learning Toolbox<br /><a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ludwig/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ludwig/</a></li>\n<li>[Uber Open Source] Ludwig: A Code-free Deep Learning Toolbox<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns_6Ep7GAIM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns_6Ep7GAIM</a></li>\n<li>Ludwig: Declarative Deep Learning feat.

At the least, the best I can do, it is simply publishing these personal videos to increase: brand awareness, SERP, SEO&#8230;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to some security issues, I cannot inflate my personal YouTube channel with numerous videos that I made professionally so it may increase the anemic number of views 🙂</p>\n<p>You do not have to be a brilliant expert to know that Google Search Engine has taken note that videos are being among the most effective content types to reach and engage audience.</p>\n<p>I was wondering how to proceed with the minimum of work! Efficiency with less waste possible was my objective and without butchering the job!</p>\n<p>I started with a project based on JSON youtube API Calls and it end up with a WordPress Plugin made up in more or less 2 hours.<br />\nWell, there is several explanations to the mutation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have unemployed plugin source code for quotes that was easily converted to videos management. Massive replacement is key, just check the readme on Github.\n<li>Leveraging on YT API was a potentiality but it means that most of the work was dedicated to coding and not to content management itself, smooth integration and user experience inside WordPress as I am running my own theme named Zaatar.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For these 2 main reasons, I decided to go for a simple WP plugin. You can find more information on the readme on the GitHub directory.<br />\nThere is a third reason, I start to have a keen interest on Python but it is no help in dealing with my WP blog!</p>\n<p><b>One last word&#8230;</b><br />\nI know it is a &#8220;cheap&#8221; post but after all that the purpose of this blog to keep track of what was one of my preoccupations for the last week. It is also to save some works (files essentially) on GitHub instead of deleting its when the job is done.</p>\n<p>Also, having the plugin installed online forced me to rework the design video output as the result was at first very ugly. So, some editorial ideas came out&#8230; It reminds me that issuing quickly the feature is always better than keep it until it is supposed to be perfect and most of the work was indeed on look and feel and content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin <code>bf_videos_manager_all</code> can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/PluginWordpressForFun/tree/master/bf_videos_manager_all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/PluginWordpressForFun/tree/master/bf_videos_manager_all</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Read more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All you to know on a hexedecimal color.

      "rendered": "<p>Still digging, in Python, on more versatile usage in object detection from images to improve a house-made CMS multimedia searches. What a sentence! So, maybe, you have heard about the acronym YOLO one stands for &#8220;You Only Live Once&#8221;, a kind of modern version of the Latin &#8220;Carpe Diem&#8221;, the other YOLO stands for &#8220;You Only Look Once&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So, let’s give a quick definition of the second YOLO thing and it&#8217;s all about image recognition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_playing_with_object_detection_opencv_yolo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">All the files can be found on my github account at https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_playing_with_object_detection_opencv_yolo</a></p>\n<h3>What is this other YOLO thing?</h3>\n<p><b>YOLO is an extremely fast multi object detection algorithm which uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and identify objects. Maybe less sexy than the first definition but pretty useful when like me you try to increase the images library relevance categorization&#8230;</b></p>\n<p><i>At least, I also like the name of the library YOLO. I was figured out a funny dialog between developers mimicking pseudo rappers &#8220;What kinda python lib do you like, Bro!&#8221;, &#8220;YOLO, man! Totally. Need to check it out NOW!&#8221; 🙂</i></p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s expose my objective.</p>\n<h3>To make better image categorization for a CMS</h3>\n<p>I have already exposed the issue, I am tackling with it already in a previous post dedicated to facial recognition.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are interested, you can check the post &#8220;Improve a CMS’s photos library qualification with AI, facial recognition in python, to provide better images search results to users&#8221; at <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/2020/06/improve-a-cms-photos-library-qualification-with-ai-facial-recognition-in-python-to-provide-better-images-search-results-to-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://flaven.fr/2020/06/improve-a-cms-photos-library-qualification-with-ai-facial-recognition-in-python-to-provide-better-images-search-results-to-users/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you ever read that post&#8217;s blog, I made few attempts on facial recognition with people faces mostly presidents. On a very European centric point of view, presidents can be range from known, less know to totally unknow!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is OK for human faces but not for any other element inside pictures to be recognized e.g. cars, buildings, dog, horse, human, tree&#8230;. whatever.</p>\n<p>Well, as I am consistent or stubborn, my objective is still the same as a Backoffice&#8217;s PO: the multimedia library carries thousand of images that are uncorrectly tagged: no caption, no keywords&#8230; etc So, performing searches on that dataset is problematic. To be even more straightforward, I will answer &#8220;GIGO&#8221;, the famous &#8220;Garbage In, Garbage Out&#8221;. GIGO produces search results that suck! So how can the situation be improved, one possibility is to enhance image search with a fine-grained keywords attached to each picture but without making the job by humans. This is where you&#8217;d better call IA to the rescue.</p>\n<p>Like always that is very practical issue, I won&#8217;t give you any explanations about the YOLO algorithm and what is &#8220;behind the curtain&#8221; with matrix and formula stuff both because it does not really interest me, I am user first and also because I am just no able to do so! No, I will focus on results !</p>\n<h3>Set-up your environnement</h3>\n<p>At the very beginning, I was looking for an example using TensorFlow Image Recognition but I decide to go for YOLO. I found it much easier to implement. Let&#8217;s see quickly what you need to play with YOLO.</p>\n<p><b>Python librairies</b><br />\nFirst, I am using my mac and a remote disk to install all the required libraries with the help of anaconda, to save space disk.

You can just download the file coco_es.names from my github account. Meaning that I can tag in any language (English, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese&#8230;) images with the help of YOLO. So, for instance, I can provide a better image search in any language by providing a native language tagging system for the same dataset of images.<br />\nAfter, that, you can even improve the tagging system by coupling it with facial recognition. Using the principles detailed in my previous post on facial recognition, you&#8217;ll be able to precise who are the persons on pictures if it is a president, an NBA star&#8230; whatever the known faces images you drop in your sample aka the directory of know faces! So, that can inject proper noun like Macron, Trump, Bryan, Biden&#8230; in addition to the keyword created by YOLO for &#8220;person&#8221;. Then you are good! By injecting these new tags into the real multimedia database used in the CMS, you may considerably improve users&#8217; images searches and never felt anymore so miserable!</p>\n<p><i>Image copyright is <a href=\"https://www.vexels.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.vexels.com</a></i></p>\n<h3>Read more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Convenient functions for YOLO v4 based on AlexeyAB Darknet Yolo.<br /><a href=\"https://darknet.gong.im/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://darknet.gong.im/</a></li>\n<li>Darknet: Open Source Neural Networks in C<br /><a href=\"https://pjreddie.com/darknet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://pjreddie.com/darknet/</a></li>\n<li>How to Perform YOLO Object Detection using OpenCV and PyTorch in Python<br /><a href=\"https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv-and-pytorch-in-python\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv-and-pytorch-in-python</a></li>\n<li>yoloface<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface</a></li>\n<li>Working With Files in Python<br /><a href=\"https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/#listing-all-files-in-a-directory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/#listing-all-files-in-a-directory<br />\n</a></li>\n<li>darknet<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet</a></li>\n<li>TensorFlow Image Recognition Python API Tutorial<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tensorflow-image-recognition-python-api-e35f7d412a70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/tensorflow-image-recognition-python-api-e35f7d412a70</a></li>\n<li>Object Detection with ImageAI in Python<br /><a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/object-detection-with-imageai-in-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://stackabuse.com/object-detection-with-imageai-in-python/</a></li>\n<li>YOLO Object Detection from image with OpenCV and Python<br /><a href=\"https://www.codespeedy.com/yolo-object-detection-from-image-with-opencv-and-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.codespeedy.com/yolo-object-detection-from-image-with-opencv-and-python/</a></li>\n<li>Run YoloV3 detections on thousands of images and save outputs?

This post is available on this blog and a very basic WP plugin code that help to FactCheck was released too.

It is like &#8220;emptying the sea with a spoon&#8221;. That&#8217;s remind me the ancient usage controversy between search engine (Google) and links catalogue (Yahoo) in the 2000&#8217;s where the links&#8217; inflation ruined at least Yahoo and made Google&#8217;s fortune. You cannot defeat figures.</p>\n<p>I guess that fake news phenomenon is so important nowadays that you have to find a way to delegate indexation and analysis of fake news to computers and not to humans.</p>\n<p><b>As I am learning NLP (Natural Language Processing), I was asking myself: &#8220;Does NLP can come to the rescue to unmask these &#8220;mother fakers&#8221; behind this modern plague?&#8221;.

Connect with Chase Thompson on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wchasethompson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/wchasethompson</a></i></p>\n<p><b>All the files can be found on my githib account at <a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/fake_news_nlp_detection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/fake_news_nlp_detection</a></b></p>\n<h3>Fake news detection with python &#8211; the environment</h3>\n<p>In practice, fake news detection required the install of a tremendous number of python librairies such as : nltk, seaborn, wordcloud, PIL, BeautifulSoup, sklearn, keras, tensorflow&#8230; etc.</p>\n<p>In several previous blog posts, I explained how to perform these installations either with Anaconda or Pip. What work for me was mainly Pip and that&#8217;s all. Here is below a quick reminder to perform the install through the Mac console.</p>\n<p><b>The command to install the librairies</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n# to install tensorflow and keras\r\n# be careful tensorflow and keras require a lot of space disk \r\npip install tensorflow\r\npip install keras\r\n\r\n# I guess you can run the same command pip install [library_name] to install\r\n# the following librairies : nltk, seaborn, wordcloud, PIL, BeautifulSoup, sklearn, keras, tensorflow... etc.\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<h3>Not a jupyter notebook, just a simple python script with comments</h3>\n<p>About the jupyter notebook, I am not really fond of jupyter notebook, I&#8217;d rather user standard python file to discover and execute script. I know jupyter notebook is made for true educational purpose but I prefer the logic of the code exposed in a script! So for both of these 2 articles that I have selected that are by the way almost identical, I converted the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file into a standard python script (.py) and slightly rewrite the script to underline the script main steps. Anyway, I keep track on how to launch a Jupyter Notebook for the record.</p>\n<p><b>How to launch  a Jupyter Notebook App on a mac</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on spotlight, type terminal to open a terminal window.</li>\n<li>Enter the startup folder by typing cd /some_folder_name.\n<pre lang=\"bash\">cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/02_copy/_000_IA_bruno_light/article_bert_detecting_fake_news_1/fake-news-nlp-master/</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Type <code>jupyter notebook</code> to launch the Jupyter Notebook App e.g fake-news-nlp-master_2.ipynb The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab then you just click on the *.ipynb\n<pre lang=\"bash\">jupyter notebook</pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html</a></i></p>\n<h3>Light changes in the python script</h3>\n<p>Here are the light changes I made to make it understandable and easier to use:</p>\n<p>1. I have reduced the sample just because my mac is almost dying when I am loading the dataset.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# Import our data\r\n\r\n# an insignificant dataset with 3 records\r\n# true = pd.read_csv(\"TrueSmallSample.csv\")\r\n# fake = pd.read_csv(\"FakeSmallSample.csv\")\r\n\r\n# a medium dataset with 90 records\r\ntrue = pd.read_csv(\"TrueMediumSample.csv\")\r\nfake = pd.read_csv(\"FakeMediumSample.csv\")\r\n\r\n# the complete dataset\r\n# true = pd.read_csv(\"TrueBigSample.csv\")\r\n# fake = pd.read_csv(\"FakeBigSample.csv\")\r\n</pre>\n<p>2. I’d rather save image files than show it. Why? First to preserve my mac, at the same time I am working.. so I don&#8217;t want my mac to turn as a zombie. Second, I don’t like when the script flow is interrupted by image generation.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# PICTURE_3 OUTPUT\r\n\"\"\" Article Subjects By Type \"\"\"\r\nplt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))\r\nsns.countplot(x='subject', hue='category', data=df)\r\nplt.title('Article Subjects By Type', fontsize=24)\r\nplt.ylabel('Total', fontsize=16)\r\nplt.xlabel('')\r\nplt.xticks(fontsize=12)\r\nplt.legend(['Fake', 'Real'])\r\n# plt.show()\r\nplt.savefig('picture_3_article_subjects_by_type.png')\r\nprint(\"\\n--- # PICTURE_3 OUTPUT \")\r\n</pre>\n<p>3. I print significant results inside the console every time, it is meaningful like in a kind jupyter notebook&#8230; e.g. # PICTURE_3 OUTPUT I know it may sound contradictory but the jupyter notebook is too CPU intensive. </p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# Let's explore the data at a base level\r\n\r\nsample_true = true.sample(20)\r\nsample_fake = fake.sample(20)\r\n\r\nprint(\"\\n--- sample_true only 20\")\r\nprint (sample_true)\r\nprint(\"\\n--- sample_true only 20\")\r\nprint(sample_fake)\r\n</pre>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>\n<p>Well with only few searches, and a very fresh understanding of NLP, I was able to find some basic scripts that are supposed to help me detect Fake News. Indeed, Fake News blossomed everywhere and constantly in digital media and social networks. It is one of the symptoms of the scary Post-truth phenomenon. Just think for a minute about the news &#8220;bullshitt&#8221; talking about the COVID-19, the vaccine or some social issues.</p>\n<p>For sure, detecting fake news may become increasingly necessary and due to the volume why don&#8217;t we apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP). I guess, it will be required for future journalists to manipulate more advanced tools to detect Fake News like they already learn how to make video shooting with mobile for social networks!</p>\n<p>Well, ok fine, another tech answer to a human problem! But, in Fake News, there are backslashes with already more pernicious consequences: Journalists&#8217; self-censorship or the fact that news are no more about truth or fake but it is more a matter of belief than anything else!</p>\n<h3>Read more</h3>\n<h4>FAKE NEWS DETECTION</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An Exhaustive Guide to Detecting and Fighting Neural Fake News using NLP<br /><a href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/12/detect-fight-neural-fake-news-nlp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/12/detect-fight-neural-fake-news-nlp/</a></li>\n<li>Fake News Detection  Edit Task on paperswithcode.com<br /><a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/task/fake-news-detection/latest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://paperswithcode.com/task/fake-news-detection/latest</a></li>\n<li>Detecting Fake News with Scikit-Learn<br /><a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-fake-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-fake-news</a></li>\n<li>How can Machine Learning and AI help solving the Fake News Problem?<br /><a href=\"https://miguelmalvarez.com/2017/03/23/how-can-machine-learning-and-ai-help-solving-the-fake-news-problem/\">https://miguelmalvarez.com/2017/03/23/how-can-machine-learning-and-ai-help-solving-the-fake-news-problem/</a></li>\n<li>Public repositories matching the topic: &#8220;fake-news&#8221; on github.com<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/topics/fake-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/topics/fake-news</a></li>\n<li>I trained fake news detection AI with >95% accuracy, and almost went crazy<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/i-trained-fake-news-detection-ai-with-95-accuracy-and-almost-went-crazy-d10589aa57c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/i-trained-fake-news-detection-ai-with-95-accuracy-and-almost-went-crazy-d10589aa57c</a></li>\n<li>Fighting post-truth using natural language processing: A review and open challenges<br /><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741741930661X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741741930661X</a></li>\n<li>Detecting Fake News With and Without Code: Comparing different NLP techniques and methods with Python and other tools to detect fake news.<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-fake-news-with-and-without-code-dd330ed449d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-fake-news-with-and-without-code-dd330ed449d9</a></li>\n<li>FakeNewsDetectionFr: Detect French Fake News<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/jeugregg/FakeNewsDetectionFr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/jeugregg/FakeNewsDetectionFr</a></li>\n<li>How do you recognize Fake News?<br /><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/how-do-you-recognize-fake-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/how-do-you-recognize-fake-news</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<h4>Using BERT</h4>\n<p>Some other resources about Bert but for another use case.</p>\n<li>Natural Language Generation using BERT: Text Generation using BERT Model<br /><a href=\"https://medium.com/intel-student-ambassadors/natural-language-generation-using-bert-df6d863c3f52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://medium.com/intel-student-ambassadors/natural-language-generation-using-bert-df6d863c3f52</a></li>\n<li>Can you use BERT to generate text?<br /><a href=\"https://mayhewsw.github.io/2019/01/16/can-bert-generate-text/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mayhewsw.github.io/2019/01/16/can-bert-generate-text/</a></li>\n<li>BERT Explained: A Complete Guide with Theory and Tutorial<br /><a href=\"https://towardsml.com/2019/09/17/bert-explained-a-complete-guide-with-theory-and-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsml.com/2019/09/17/bert-explained-a-complete-guide-with-theory-and-tutorial/</a></li>\n<li>BERT for text summarization<br /><a href=\"https://iq.opengenus.org/bert-for-text-summarization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://iq.opengenus.org/bert-for-text-summarization/</a></li>\n<li>BERT Text Classification Using Pytorch<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-text-classification-using-pytorch-723dfb8b6b5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-text-classification-using-pytorch-723dfb8b6b5bs</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Order is a very relative notion, it is specific for each of us. &#8220;The world is my representation&#8221; as Arthur &#8220;Chop&#8221; Schopenhauer says.  At the same time, experience teaches us &#8220;Every cloud has a silver lining&#8221; so modestly I discovered that a relative &#8220;disorder&#8221; is often more efficient than an absolute &#8220;order&#8221;. Right? Ooh slow down a bit! It is not an easy-peasy Q/A!</p>\n<p>For sure, you can ask yourself why such interrogations are part of a so called post dedicated to Python. Well, first of all, it make sense for me for several reasons:</p>\n<p>Never bad to introduce some philosophy in programming practice. Personally, it reconciles two of my favorite hobbies (bad programming &#038; cheap philosophy) to one : headache! More serioulsy, these thoughts come from a practical and real-world experience.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you the story: after a long, long aging process, as a PO, I achieved to build a robust testing strategy with CodeceptJS for a backoffice! But then I discovered that the e2e sequential execution of the suite created a bias (let&#8217;s called them errors). OMG! Then I was wondering how to introduce randomization inside the testing suite execution in order to reduce this bias to the maximum. The purpose is to avoid the false positive nightmare!</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a completely chaotic, confused, disordered, disorganized, topsy-turvy, helter-skelter, pell-mell, upside-down, higgledy-piggledy, hugger-mugger, harum-scarum, snafu, slipshod, unplanned, erratic, strayed, hit-and-miss, incidental, spontaneous, uncoordinated, willy-nilly, devil-may-care, unpremeditated, reckless, cockeyed, hit-and-miss, fluky, incidental&#8230; anarchic way, I am learning advanced Python techniques (NLP, facial recognition &#8230;) but also fundamentals like the difference between a &#8220;tuple&#8221; and a &#8220;dictionary&#8221;. <b>So it was logic that Python popped up in my mind to bring this randomness, given the complexity of doing the same thing in Bash, a language that I am far from mastering!</b></p>\n<p><b>Incidentally, this experiment proves me that Python is: </b> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Easy to read:</b> Python is easy to read and most of the language makes sense at a glimpse. This makes finding issues a lot easier than more complicated languages.</li>\n<li><b>Portability:</b> Python runs on many platforms and systems, meaning your programs can reach a wider audience. It can easily replace Bash or Ruby of instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two qualities that gave Python a serious advantage in what I am looking for: to create on-demand order or disorder 🙂</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order: when it comes to browsing, summarizing and indexing hundreds of texts in order to store them in a database itself MySQL and/or NoSQL.</li>\n<li>Disorder: when it comes to run tests in parallel, for example, and thereby overcome a bias linked to a sequential execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Oddly, sometimes, Disorder proves to be more efficient and effective than Order.</b></p>\n<p>So, this post presents my quick researches on how-to handle random in Python. Having in mind that the final objective is to load randomly testing files that achieve a complete Backoffice&#8217;s assessment without increasing errors into the process.</p>\n<p><b>By the way, it reveals a third and fourth Python qualities:</b> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Increasing productivity:</b> how much work you can accomplish in a given time with few lines of code.</li>\n<li><b>Relieving Boring Stuff in Bullshit Jobs:</b> Thanks to Al Sweigart and David Graeber to have enabled me to create this &#8220;tuna-mayo-sandwich&#8221; concept.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, now, let&#8217;s move on and show some code&#8230;</p>\n<h2>The code for this POC</h2>\n<p>A mix of files that show some concepts explained above.

As a CMS &#8220;manufacturer&#8221; or PO, I was wondering what advantages I can withdraw from NLP. Concretely, it means exploring and learning Python to improve both user support (FAQs turn as a Chatbot, analyzing User Feedback&#8230;) but also think about some editorial features especially with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>\n<p>I am wrestling with the subject for too long because there are tons of libraries and tutorials introducing to Python and NLP! Looking for python is an heavy trend. Apparently, Google users in America have searched for Python more often than for Kim Kardashian.

These IA tools exerts an undeniable fascination. Why? These are new tools that actually begin to think and act on its own. The idea that these tools will make decisions and undertake actions on their own is fascinating and scary at the same time. I was wondering if any critical thinking existed towards the deafening consensus on AI?<br />\nI found some opponents, on a philosophical point of view. Even though, IA fanatics report that the AI promise is to &#8220;Humanize the machine, not mechanize the User&#8221;, the main critic remains the AI&#8217;s &#8220;injunctive power&#8221;. Combined with consent, it makes an unstoppable combination to turn us mankind into passive and obedient sheeps! By the way, the GAFAS, that promote IA, never really assumed they were the bad guy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, IA can been seen as the ultimate market achievement where, reduced as consumers, we only take decisions with utilitarian goals, &#8220;obeying&#8221; to IA.</p>\n<p>Regarding NLP, the disturbing thing is the familiar form that this injunction takes. The Chatbot speaks to you, the NLP writes and advises you with your own words&#8230; This is step forward to a very persuasive soft power. So, is the very idea of rebelling still even exist as it sounds ludicrous, to fight with a friend!</p>\n<p>What I mostly remember from this reading:<br />\n&#8211; IA is a threat to humanity, especially our free will.<br />\n&#8211; IA is the ultimate version of &#8220;Invisible hand&#8221;, so criticizing IA seems to be the way to &#8220;burn down&#8221; the system aka capitalism, GAFAS (Facebook, Google, Amazon&#8230; etc. that are mostly behind the IA libraries and expect something in return: your datas so you can be profiled.</p>\n<p>Even though it is nowadays almost impossible to avoid IA, that&#8217;s always good to read opinions against the mainstream way of thinking so you’ll be aware of the potential IA’s threats!</p>\n<li>L&#8217; Intelligence artificielle ou l’enjeu du siècle: Anatomie d’un antihumanisme radical de Eric Sadin (French)<br /><a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/Lintelligence-artificielle-lenjeu-si%C3%A8cle-antihumanisme/dp/2373090503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.fr/Lintelligence-artificielle-lenjeu-si%C3%A8cle-antihumanisme/dp/2373090503</a></li>\n<li>Peter W.

How can I use NLP?</h2>\n<p>I wonder more and more if the target has not become to even drop PHP to build a web application. Is refactoring a PHP legacy Code in Python is an option?</p>\n<p>Indeed, building a web application, I do not even talk about a website seems to be easy nowadays. You can gather an effective SPA (Single Page Application) in a very short time but providing meaningful and advanced features for a CMS is much trickier! </p>\n<p>To be totally transparent, a simple question is spinning around in my head: How can I add some &#8220;intelligent&#8221; functionalities, using these Python libraries, to an existing CMS made in PHP (Laravel or Symfony for instance)? Apparently, the way seems to build a separate API in Python that will brigde with PHP!</p>\n<p>Like I said in my previous post, these NLP libraries are not only enabling new tasks to be made but these libraries can even carry out tasks like a real human such as me a P.O for a Backoffice! Great, I am outsourcing myself.</p>\n<h2>Using Anaconda</h2>\n<p>A reminder for useful commands with Anaconda</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\r\n# Check Anaconda installation\r\nconda --version\r\n\r\n# Update conda\r\nconda update -n base -c defaults conda\r\n\r\n# Create an environment\r\n# environment with Python 3.5\r\nconda create --name myEnvironmentOne python=3.5\r\n\r\n# launch a script named 006_nltk_cookbook_test.py\r\n--- python 006_nltk_cookbook_test.py\r\n\r\n# Get into the env named myEnvironmentOne\r\nconda activate myEnvironmentOne\r\n\r\n# get out from an env\r\nconda deactivate\r\n\r\n# By default you are in the base env no need to activate\r\n# conda activate base\r\n</pre>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>This reading gave me an overview of the Python&#8217;s possibilities in terms of text understanding. NLP seems to be progressing more and more every day and remains fairly accessible if you do not pretend to be a specialist! It would be a shame to do without it while waiting to see progress in text&#8217;s generation with BERT for example.</p>\n<p><b> To remove doubts about the NLP&#8217;s potential, this post underwent both a keyword extraction and summarization operations with the help of 2 scripts given here as example. The result is not bad! It is a true crutch for a rookie journalist like me! You can see below the result.</b></p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\">\r\n# result for post tags\r\npython, nlp, spacy, ia, chatbot\r\n\r\n# summarization result\r\nThese videos are giving some enlightening on nlp's concepts such as stemming, tokenization, tokenizer or bag of words or even some explanations on different type of ia’s network such as convolutional neural network and the way to use it.here is a posts'digest to start with nlp oriented around 2 basic usages, that can be implemented in a cms: practical use cases in a cms's support and simple techniques to extract keywords or even \"slice\" a post. Rake extracts keywords that should describe the main topics expressed in a document. An article from ng wai foong and some other examples from the great official spacy documentation show how to quickly get to grip with spacy. Concretely, it means exploring and learning python to improve both user support (faqs turn as a chatbot, analyzing user feedback...) but also think about some editorial features especially with the help of natural language processing (nlp).\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Read more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create your chatbot using Python NLTK<br /><a href=\"https://medium.com/predict/create-your-chatbot-using-python-nltk-761cd0aeaed3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://medium.com/predict/create-your-chatbot-using-python-nltk-761cd0aeaed3</a></li>\n<li>Building Language Models (nlpforhackers)<br /><a href=\"https://nlpforhackers.io/language-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://nlpforhackers.io/language-models/</a></li>\n<li>Deploying a Text Classification Model Using Flask and Vue.js<br /><a href=\"https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/deploying-a-text-classification-model-using-flask-and-vue-js-25b9aa7ff048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/deploying-a-text-classification-model-using-flask-and-vue-js-25b9aa7ff048</a></li>\n<li>Text Generation with Python and TensorFlow/Keras<br /><a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/text-generation-with-python-and-tensorflow-keras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://stackabuse.com/text-generation-with-python-and-tensorflow-keras/</a></li>\n<li>TEXT CLASSIFICATION WITH TORCHTEXT<br /><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html</a></li>\n<li>Text Analysis by monkeylearn<br /><a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/text-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://monkeylearn.com/text-analysis/</a></li>\n<li>BERT Word Embeddings Tutorial<br /><a href=\"https://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/</a></li>\n<li>A Hacker&#8217;s Guide to Python string and Natural Language Processing (NLP) packages<br /><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/brianspiering/64b2256f25880a97936c198955b437e1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://gist.github.com/brianspiering/64b2256f25880a97936c198955b437e1</a></li>\n<li>List of free resources to learn Natural Language Processing<br />\n<br /><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/list-of-free-resources-to-learn-natural-language-processing-5bc4b76db552\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://hackernoon.com/list-of-free-resources-to-learn-natural-language-processing-5bc4b76db552</a></li>\n<li>How I built and launched an AI product for under $100<br /><a href=\"https://blog.usejournal.com/how-i-built-and-launched-an-ai-product-for-under-100-6284646ec56b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.usejournal.com/how-i-built-and-launched-an-ai-product-for-under-100-6284646ec56b</a></li>\n<li>Building Chatbots – Introduction<br /><a href=\"https://nlpforhackers.io/chatbots-introduction/#more-8595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://nlpforhackers.io/chatbots-introduction/#more-8595</a></li>\n<p><b>API python + vue.js</b></p>\n<li>Developing a Single Page App with Flask and Vue.js<br /><a href=\"https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/</a></li>\n<li>Using Vue.js To Create An Interactive Weather Dashboard With APIs<br /><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/interactive-weather-dashboard-api-vue-js/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/interactive-weather-dashboard-api-vue-js/</a></li>\n<li>Sample dockerized environmennt with Vue.js and Python API<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/e0ne/docker-vuejs-python-nginx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/e0ne/docker-vuejs-python-nginx</a></li>\n<li>Building a Google search clone SPA with Vue and Flask<br /><a href=\"https://scotch.io/bar-talk/\nbuilding-a-google-search-clone-spa-with-vue-and-flask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://scotch.io/bar-talk/<br />\nbuilding-a-google-search-clone-spa-with-vue-and-flask</a></li>\n<li>Training Tensorflow Object Detection API with custom dataset for working in Javascript and Vue.js<br /><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/training-tensorflow-object-detection-api-with-custom-dataset-for-working-in-javascript-and-vue-js-6634e0f33e03\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://towardsdatascience.com/training-tensorflow-object-detection-api-with-custom-dataset-for-working-in-javascript-and-vue-js-6634e0f33e03</a></li>\n<li>Flask-RESTful &#8211;

Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was bewitched me 🙂 So, I gained confidence using Python in order to explore AI librairies such as NTLK, OpenCV or face_recognition from ageitgey (Adam Geitgey).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_playing_with_facial_recognition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You can find the files in my github account More on https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/ in python_playing_with_facial_recognition</a></p>\n<p><b>This post is about a real issue that can be solved by IA. I believe that for any technical topic, rather than exploring AI documentation which in itself could be quite wastful. I always strive to tackle a real use case and apply as much as possible what I want to discover.</b></p>\n<p>So, applying this principle, I have spotted facial recognition for pictures. Like many, I am iOS mobile Phone user and I saw facial recognition at work. I start to wonder: &#8220;How can apply those facial recognition principles in a backoffice?&#8221;. As I am currently a PO for a Backoffice, I am supposed to have a clear &#8220;vision&#8221; of my product but more than that I know perfectly its weaknesses, especially dealing with pictures.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this simple question allows me not to stress about the details right away and instead quickly jot something down as a placeholder for a conversation between me, myself and I, a soliloquy. The intent was to not forget to ask all the right questions either upfront or somewhere down the road but do not prevent from starting a P.O.C.</p>\n<p>Here is my shortlist that highlights some of the functional and nonfunctional concerns or requirements that I wanted to address. This list has driven all my decisions to obtain a pragmatic result without missing the goal.</p>\n<p><b>Goal:</b> How can apply those facial recognition principles in a Backoffice  in order to improve image search results at the end?</p>\n<p><b>Short actions todolist:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Browse unknown people images directory with Facial Recognition Script</li>\n<li>Detect known people faces among these images set them aside</li>\n<li>Insert these known people images in a MySQL database</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Requirement:</b> This Spike will be all made in Python but I do not want to end up with an overzealous shopping list of requirements.</p>\n<p>Let me explain the situation. In the Backoffice, which I am dealing with, is hosting thousand of &#8220;unqualified&#8221; images that contains faces of:  Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Vladimir Poutine, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or less kwnown poeple in an european centric point of view: Macky Sall, Rodrigo Duterte, Ramzan Kadyrov, Hun Sen, Narendra Modi, Hassan Rohani, Stevo Pendarovski, Nicolás Maduro, Edgar Lungu&#8230;</p>\n<p><b>Remember that we still need a human intelligence to say who is who? For your information, Stevo Pendarovski, Стево Пендаровски, is president of North Macedonia, holding the office since 12 May 2019 and he looks a bit like me 🙂 or that is just the glasses.</b></p>\n<p><b>The face of Stevo Pendarovski, Стево Пендаровски, president of North Macedonia</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/facial_recognition_stevo_pendarovski.jpeg\" alt=\"Improve a CMS's photos library qualification with AI, facial recognition in python, to provide better images search results to users\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\" /></p>\n<p><b>The idea is to increase the relevance of research and reduce the sample of images that will be retrieved with a traditionnal textual search based on their name. It will save time, money and resources but also improve user experience. So, user do not get no results at all or improper results in his/her image search.</b></p>\n<p>The fact, no one wants to qualify each image by opening them one after the other, adding correct caption to improve indexation and by consequence future&#8217;s search results. We are talking about more than 1 500 000 pictures. Indeed, the wise choice is to leave it to a computer. </p>\n<p>This is where the &#8220;US cavalry&#8221; comes to the rescue in the person of facial recognition library. This library will give you an easy way to detect known faces e.g. list of current state leaders, across all these images.</p>\n<p>The machine learning is here for that and there are tons of pre-trained models and ready to go libraries that you can use. With this magic wand, you properly scale up your skills and impress your friends or your mother. &#8220;Look mummy, I am a data scientist!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>As the facial recognition library will truly analyzed the images, it will prevent you to mix up images search with common namesake or word-sense disambiguation. For instance, you can make a difference between Michelle and Barack Obama or if you type Bush and you are looking for the 2 former US presidents, you won&#8217;t get australian bush&#8217;s pictures.</p>\n<p>At the end, as a collateral &#8220;damage&#8221;, when the requalification will be impleteted in the media database, you&#8217;ll be able to improve the UX by adding a filter named such as &#8220;Portrait&#8221; in source selection dropdown menu. Menu that already contains filters like Editorial, Broadcast, Press agency and let the user select source for his/her images search.</p>\n<p><b>One last thing, on an historical point of view, what conclusion can we draw from this allegedly harmless experience?</b></p>\n<p>In the last century, robotization has replaced blue-collar workers in an automobile assembly line for instance. Let&#8217;s say ending mass employment in the  first industrial revolution industries. What about our nowadays industries? I guess that IA will certainly replace human intelligence e.g. white-collar workers for tedious and repetitive administrative works such as writing meeting minutes, sorting pictures, sorting documents, answering to questions&#8230;. and maybe even more creative works! </p>\n<p>As I speak to you, it is no more a dystopia! IA is creeping everywhere. Exception made in some companies where people are still working like in caveman age. In this case, the purpose here is to &#8220;buy social peace&#8221; by keeping obsolete jobs alive! Well, sooner or later, there will be an arbitration between some of your job&#8217;s tasks and their possible carry out by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Is there a name for this phenomenon? Anyway, you&#8217;ll be facing soon this &#8220;intelligentization&#8221; or &#8220;artificialization&#8221; of your job so you&#8217;d better be ready! I do not even mention the IA’s usage especially facial recognition in surveillance and security that is already a standard!</p>\n<p><b>Never forget that modern capitalism loves creative destruction and see AI as a disrupting factor in many industries. This is such a growing question that there&#8217;s even a website called, &#8220;Will Robots Take My Job?&#8221;. The website&#8217;s name speaks for itself.

It was basically to build a multifunction JSON structure. This one could be used to display any content in hierarchical list e.g. FAQs, Changelogs, Quotes, TODOs, Shopping list items&#8230; etc.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, I got interested again in the JSON-Schema, discovered with Postman. Since when you use JSON content, you quickly need to make sure that the content as well as the structure will remain perennial. Davvero Leo!**</p>\n<p><i>** The guy I am working with is called Leo.</i></p>\n<p>I was bound to ramble into random exploratory directions that made me discover the followings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The opportunity to modestly make some Python &#038; install and explore Anaconda for testing purposes in JSON-schema.</li>\n<li>The Anaconda install was also the opportunity to dig into various librairies such as Tensorflow, Keras (multifunction), NTLK (language), OpenCV (images) and many others. Spearheads of the magic trio: AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning. Some posts may show up about these subjects in the future.</li>\n<li>A quick exporation of Pippin Williamson&#8217;s WP plugin.<br />\n(https://pippinsplugins.com/).</li>\n<li>Some Screens Prototypes in Balsamiq.</li>\n<li>Concepts extracted from reading &#8220;UX for Developers<br />\nHow to Integrate User-Centered Design Principles Into Your Day-to-Day Development Work &#8220;by Westley Knight.</li>\n<li>Different tests of creation of JSON as well as the different JSON-SCHEMA which are attached to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>At the end of this &#8220;fishing&#8221; session, you must, without shame, show your catch as ridiculous as it is and I can draw 2 conclusions from this experience.</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Learn-It-All Mindset Beats the Know-It-All Mindset:</b> Exposing the trial and error process to all is essential.

Prototyping</b><br />\nWith Balsamiq, as a P.O, you can quickly prototype. I even sometime make video presentation as Balsamiq enables to go full screen and interact with your prototype.</p>\n<p>Prototyping is a way in which organizations are able to get an idea of how a feature or product may look and function like without spending a great deal of time and money to create the finished article. It is a time savier.</p>\n<p>The more you get closer to the feature and its cinematic, the more you are able to assess the needs of those users when they will be engaged with your interface. With Prototyping, as a P.O, you can even guess what will be the user&#8217;s feedback generated. You really put user&#8217;s interactions in a middle of your work, and to answering to the user riddle: &#8220;What will be the mental, physical, and emotional responses from the user towards the product?&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>For sure, in such simple screens, it easy to answer, just check out the spelling mistakes for your FAQs or for the CHANGELOG 🙂 Below, some extract pieces from a prototype, I guess the rest is confidential !</b></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/changed_screen_1_about_CHANGELOG_small.png\" alt=\"Python, Anaconda, Worpress, JSON, JSON-SCHEMA - Messy post with few practices and feedback from my P.O experience.\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/changed_screen_2_about_FAQs_small.png\" alt=\"Python, Anaconda, Worpress, JSON, JSON-SCHEMA - Messy post with few practices and feedback from my P.O experience.\" width=\"585\" height=\"330\"></p>\n<h3>Read more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Building a settings import and export feature</b><br /><a href=\"http://pippinsplugins.com/building-settings-import-export-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://pippinsplugins.com/building-settings-import-export-feature/</a></li>\n<li><b>jsonschema is an implementation of JSON Schema for Python</b><br /><a href=\"https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</a></li>\n<li><b>Miscellaneous Examples from json-schema.org</b><br /><a href=\"https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html</a></li>\n<li><b>Balsamiq.

      "rendered": "<p>Again, I guess you noticed that we entered in the knowledge ages and not just because of the lockdown. In this new economy, you have to be &#8220;creative&#8221;, &#8220;to unbound your limits&#8221; and &#8220;reveal your potential&#8221;. What a program! It is not even more an option! Moreover, you owe to be productive in creativity. Meaning that even though you do not really feel yourself as a creative person, you need sometimes to pretend to pull the wool over anyone&#8217;s eyes and it requires method. I do not say that lying must your full-time job, I&#8217;d rather say that you need self-confidence and to gain it, you need to master some tools and vocabularies and that is the real work. Just think a minute about Trump and you&#8217;ll get the point.</p>\n<p>So, in this creative inflation demand, recently, I was asked by a very close friend to explain what was Mind Mapping? I hope you heard of Mind Mapping? No?! It is one of the accessories of the creative guy&#8217;s panoply. I must admit I had a very fuzzy idea of what it is was and I dug recently to understand deeper some key elements behind MM. Here are the few ideas gathered during this shoveling experience.<br />\nSince, I am applying MM to almost everything, especially to my kids learning process as they have a fresh and unadulterated brains and as they are forced to stay around! That is a perfect transition because it reaveals both the MM promises and experiences.</p>\n<h2>1. What are the Mind Mapping (MM) promises and experiences?</h2>\n<p><b>Mind Mapping (MM) has a double objectives:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It help your brain working instead of gets in the way.</li>\n<li>It increases the efficiency with which you learn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of spending time in lectures, awkwardly transcribing, your brain does not learn chapters anyway 🙂 You have to think about it through a visual form and with a personal storytelling. If you don&#8217;t &#8220;think&#8221; about what you read or write, you will have a hard time &#8220;learning&#8221;. Your brain needs to organize it to learn it. MM is a turn-to-key solution offered to you to learn, store &#038; retrieve.</p>\n<h2>2. Mind Mapping, first practice, first observation</h2>\n<p>2 first striking facts to take-away when you practise for the first time Mind Mapping.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is like for theater, playing on stage, think practice no theory, think embodiment. MM is based on action, on doing something visual, using kinesthetic (in clear motion), use your hands, think and act at the same time, while you are doing. Do not think about tool in first place, think about practice. Like said Aristotle &#8220;the hand of man is the instrument of the instruments&#8221; period.</li>\n<li>Apparently, the MM&#8217;s strengh rely on the way brain works with association and imagination, at least if you have a brain! It plugs to the genesis of human intelligence and language based on imagination &#038; association, the genesis of creativity of all thinking. That is the main routine, the second routine is named verbal language such as Khmer, Chinese, Hausa, Portuguese, Kiswahili and French.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cool, I got the essentials, let&#8217;s practice.</p>\n<h2>3. Mind Mapping, how-to. The Mind Mapping practice</h2>\n<p>Here is the 3 basic advices to get the MM done.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>In the center of the MM, put the subject</b></li>\n<p>In the center is the subject, it could be anything: the name of the person you are listening to, the title of a book, the question you are trying to think about&#8230;</p>\n<li><b>Write down keywords</b></li>\n<p>Do not use too long sentences but rather meaningful words or very short sentences.</p>\n<li><b>Build connections these keywords</b></li>\n<p>It is very important to build connections between these keywords and that you do it radially.</p>\n</ol>\n<p><b>What could be better than Mind Mapping to answer the question &#8220;What is Mind Mapping?&#8221;.</b></p>\n<p><b>No Mind Mapping inside, ugly even though it is a readme! You should know by now how I am a big fan of readme in markdown.</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ugly_map_good_small.png\" alt=\"Using Pandoc to generate documentation, manuals in\npdf, docx, html from markdown documents\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" /></p>\n<p><b>Mind Mapping inside, much more appealing. Made with a tool called Brainio https://brainio.com/.</b><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nice_map_inside_small.png\" alt=\"Using Pandoc to generate documentation, manuals in\npdf, docx, html from markdown documents\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" /></p>\n<p>What does these pictures teach us&#8230; Except that it is in French? Well, 2 things to take away.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Mind Mapping is based on how the brain works? Right.</b><br />\nRemember the question at the beginning : &#8220;Do you think you store in your brain paragraphs or sentences?&#8221;. The anwser is no. You (your brain) store images, key ideas. You (your brain) make connections between things. You (your brain) try to learn new things by connecting them to things that we already know.</li>\n<li><b>2. The rendering of the MM: it is personal but free and somehow similar in form.</b> The rendering of the MM, on the same subject, can therefore be very different depending on the person. It is personal, free but you may obtain a similar rendering. That is somehow an illustration of the talmudic release constraint in a sense. So, it is both very personal and very free in its &#8220;ramifications&#8221; but not in its rendering. Anyone will get a central point with ramifications around it. However, these ramifications will be different because what is important to you is not important to your neighbor and because you want to remember different things on the same subject.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>4. Mind Mapping, a Swiss army knife for thinking, learning and explaining</h2>\n<p><b>Mind Mapping is a flexible and compact tool based on association.</b></p>\n<li>Mind Mapping is flexible. It helps your brain working instead of gets in the way. You already know that part.</li>\n<li>Mind Mapping is compact. You only write KWs or short sentences. These KWs or short sentences are your &#8220;triggers&#8221; to get to the bigger idea.</li>\n<p>So, in many situations, Mind Mapping can help you out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mind Mapping is a multi-function tool that speed up the process: recovery, situation, explanation.</li>\n<li>Mind Mapping is a way to easily &#8220;retrieve&#8221; what you want to talk about. MM is a fantastic way to take notes on any occasion (business meeting &#8230;)</li>\n<li>Mind Mapping is a great way to explain something to someone else. During the lockdown, my kids are the unfortunate victims of my MM&#8217;s fury.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Mind Mapping, how-to practice</h2>\n<p>Practically, this is what you need to do.</p>\n<li><b>Keep horizontal your writing paper</b><br />\nTake a white A4 sheet horizontally. Why horizontally? The reason is simple, you are writing and you reading at the same time. Words are facing the way we are usually reading.</li>\n<li><b>Write YOUR keywords</b><br />\nWrite only extremely short keywords or phrases.</li>\n<li><b>Make YOUR connections or launch &#8220;YOUR tentacles&#8221;</b><br />\nMost importantly, make connections / connectors between the elements. You build radially like the path of a thought.</li>\n<p><b>You are thinking! You are not blindly documenting, transcribing. You broke away with the paralyzing ideas such as &#8220;How will I remember it&#8221; or &#8220;How will I explain to others&#8221;. So, let&#8217;s start developing something that start in the center and builds out radially.</b></p>\n<p><b>So far, you got a very simple tool to avoid shackling your creativity and with a mix graphic facilitation, you&#8217;ll soon be sitting on top of the world of creativity 🙂</b></p>\n<p><b>Mind Mapping with a pinch of graphic facilitation.

Besides the fact that It gave you the insurance to execute properly a repetitive task, it has several benefits that I listed. I am not talking about an advanced usage made, for instance, by a web designer. The subject of this post is managing thousand of images, that is key in a digital workflow. This is one of the most time-consuming charges in the content creation workload. On my own, I made a real Spike on that subject!</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/images_treatment_photoshop_imagemagick_docker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All the files are on githubin images_treatment_photoshop_imagemagick_docker on Github</a></b></p>\n<p>For those who ignore what a Spike in Scrum? Here is a quick definition:<br />\n<i>&#8220;Spikes are an invention of Extreme Programming (XP), are a special type of user story that is used to gain the knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a story estimate. A spike has a maximum time-box size as the sprint it is contained in it. At the end of a sprint, the spike will be determined that is done or not-done just like any other ordinary user story. A Spike is a great way to mitigate risks early and allows the team ascertain feedback and develop an understanding on an upcoming PBI’s complexity.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike/</a></i></p>\n<p><b>Some benefits to move from Photoshop to Docker/Imagemagick.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Image quality:</b> no trade-off with image quality and reducing time-consuming task to work on image.</li>\n<li><b>Docker:</b> good empiric introduction to automation, industrialization, CI, with a sharable and maintainable environment.</li>\n<li><b>Open Source:</b> imagemagick, Docker are free. It is saving money and time, less training, no licensing. There is only the learning curb that may cost you time. No Pain No Gain!</li>\n<li><b>User-Experience:</b> above all saving time to work for the editorial team, time to write and think. Same usages allow better support.</li>\n<li><b>Textbook case</b> It is a pragmatic textbook case to show progress from craft usage to industrial usage and how Docker can help you in that?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, how can batch image processing can reduce this creation process from hours to just a few simple clicks? For this tedious task, why don&#8217;t we try to replace Photoshop by a bundle with Imagemagick &#038; Docker? This is the subject of this post. </p>\n<p><b>The user story will be: As an editor, journalist, contributor, I focus only on the image editorial choice and with the help of a bulk processing, a script runs to convert the images into the right format for publishing.I had always this idea somewhere in my mind to leverage on Imagemagick and Docker to batch this image treatment an give a workable alternative to Photoshop.</b></p>\n<p><b>In my github, you will find even more, a tiny manual written when I was in Zambia, 3 additional use cases and a bunch of Youtube video. I am not cheating you!</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>USECASE_1 Scripting resize with Photoshop, Scripting with Applescript and Photoshop</li>\n<li>USECASE_2 Scripting resize with Imagemagick install on your computer</li>\n<li>USECASE_3 Scripting resize with Imagemagick and Docker</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Looking for the perfect Docker image with Imagemagick</h2>\n<p>Inevitably other people, more experienced in development than I am, thought about this topic. So, my sole quest was to pull a docker image that already exist containing Imagemagick. </p>\n<p>This docker image will be the &#8220;base&#8221; for industrialization work for resizing and optimization images. This is also a &#8220;killing two birds with one stone&#8221; operation as it will de facto standardize usages and practices for any member of the editorial team and ease the support pain.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple decision criterion which militates for the choice of the Docker and Imagemagick tandem. This criterion is very simple, imagine that you must equip each computer with a Photoshop license or any software and possibly provide training, in short, this is inflation guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Another advantage, using the Docker and Imagemagick tandem will prevent you from buying, installing, training and support each user with a specific software like Photoshop or Gimp even though Gimp is free. A true nightmare.</p>\n<p>However, let&#8217;s go back to the original need: preparing images for a web or mobile publication, it is mainly to select and then resize the image that match editorially with your content and fit you applications (website, mobile application&#8230;).</p>\n<p>In a practical way, working images is essentially to export images at the right settings (72 dpi, format 16/9 or 4/3, correct filename&#8230;) and the rest we do not give a f&#8230;</p>\n<p>Implementing D&#038;I (Docker &#038; Imagemagick) will accidentally also cut down the whining refrains from anyone such as &#8220;My computer is too slow&#8221;, &#8220;I am not trained&#8221;, &#8220;I do not have the license&#8221;, &#8220;Selecting image is part of my job but not the resizing and the optimizing&#8221;&#8230; so many popular refrains whose intensity is multiplied by ten due to lockdown.</p>\n<p><b>Listing the benefits can only motivate you to adopt this solution. By the way, you can pretend it is DevOps but at the very first place, it is common sense.</b></p>\n<p>Frankly, I do not understand why on both side there is so much misunderstanding. I am about to believe that people are &#8220;stupid&#8221; when they reach their point incompetence? </p>\n<p><b>On one side, DevOps do not think about such evolution. Maybe because they ignore everything on content creation workflow. On the other side, Editorial team do not dare to ask for such tool because they basically ignore that there is a possible alternative to Photoshop for instance. Anyway, no collaboration, no smart evolution, just an incredible mess that generate endless errors and support tickets! What a waste of time!</b></p>\n<p><b>Lockdown spotlight with cruelty the lack of common understanding. You may find this conclusion bitter but unfortunately it seems to be true.</b></p>\n<p>I quote this post in my sister&#8217;s blog that summarize this impression during the lockdown.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another thing also jumps out at us: the amazing social uselessness of certain professions. Marketer, advisor, financier, manager, and so on. When I think that we have not even realized that these auxiliary services of our sophisticated economy were at a standstill. Neoliberalism will therefore have succeeded where communism had failed: employing lots of people to do unnecessary things!&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://shanghaiconfidential.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/29-mars-desafinando/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://shanghaiconfidential.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/29-mars-desafinando/</a></i></p>\n<p><b>Like said Peter Drucker: &#8220;There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><b>Time to think is over, no kidding!</b></p>\n<h2>Using the Docker image with Imagemagick</h2>\n<p>These are the main commands for exploring Imagemagick and Docker.

I always believe that there will be a future usage for these text&#8217;s chunks, somehow. I may be wrong.</p>\n<p><b>Indeed, with Mardown, you have an universal and a common format for any kind of content from text, code with syntax highlight, video, image, directory tree representation and even ASCII Art. It is very useful when you have to manage heterogenous content.</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>The logo use on the post by default came from <a href=\"https://markdown-here.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://markdown-here.com/</a>, please have a look to the website.</b></li>\n<li><b>The markdown memo can be found on my Github account @bflaven.

I think it is turning to a Word Diogenes Syndrome declination to use terms that are in the mood of time! I do not throw anything that have been written. It has to be turned to something. So, Markdown has become a natural output for the notes and you can imagine, that I am now among the Markdown fanatics! Even though the language is very basic, it does what it&#8217;s supposed to: compile key information to enable sharing and reading. What else could we ask to it? Nothing more but nothing less!</p>\n<p>I have just release books and most of them have been written in Markdown first. I compiled them after but the very source was in Markdown. As you can imagine, I made some progress but still I always look for code to cut and paste as I always forgot how to make a list, make a link, insert an image&#8230; etc.</p>\n<p><b>So, here is my small markdown template with the main reusable elements.

That was the occasion to create also a new entrance in this Blog&#8217;s menu named <a href=\"https://flaven.fr/publications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Publications&#8221;</a> Ohhhh. So, I was pretty busy. Anyway, when I decided to create my page on Amazon, I saw that I neglected my blog for 8 months, what a shame!</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Cov-19 (Corona) steps in, so I am &#8220;trapped&#8221; like anyone, experimenting &#8220;TT&#8221; aka &#8220;Télétravail&#8221; abbreviation for telecommuting or telework in French.<br />\nWhat a good kick, to &#8220;cook&#8221; for this blog-coming-back-post a short P.O survival guide in containment! There thousands and thousands of tools, so here is a not so exhaustive selection of tools available on the web. Hope you find it useful.</p>\n<p><b>A warm thanks to Tim, our Scrum Master. The guy deserve my deepest respect both for the cigarettes I have borrowed him, for his philosophic background that enables us to talk, after our daily, about Bergson or Alain and for sure for his &#8220;relentless&#8221; benevolence! He is the one who provided most of the tools quoted in the list. Thanks dude 🙂</b></p>\n<p>But here is the tools&#8217; list: short P.O survival guide in containment.</p>\n<h2>A tools shortlist guide for P.O survival in containment</p>\n<h2>\n<p><b>Some very useful tools for anyone telecommuting due to containment.</b></p>\n<h3>For a conf</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Whereby:</b> very intuitive, very user-friendly, I have even curated it to my son&#8217;s teacher to organize Classroom.  A very basic and robust tool for Online conf call management and coworking tool.<br />\n<a href=\"https://whereby.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://whereby.com</a></li>\n<li><b>Zoom.us:</b> impressive tool for Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing. Free for 2 users, Free but limited to 40 minutes if you are 3 in the meeting. I am thinking of using instead of Skype for instance.<br />\n<a href=\"https://zoom.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://zoom.us/</a></li>\n<li><b>Join.me:</b> for your Meeting &#038; Rituals, this tool is dedicated to Screen Sharing, Online Meetings, Web Conferencing. Quite OK.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.join.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.join.me/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For a agile rituals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Funretro:</b> online retro scrum tool, not bad but retro may not fun at all! 🙂<br />\n<a href=\"https://funretro.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://funretro.io</a></li>\n<li><b>VotingPoker.com:</b> a good way to organise your Planning Poker. It is very intuitive for Agile Poker Planning Tool.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.votingpoker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.votingpoker.com/</a></li>\n<li><b>Remoteretro:</b> another tool to play agile by the book. Never try. Thus, their baseline &#8220;A real-time application for conducting Agile retrospectives&#8221; is promising.<br />\n<a href=\"https://remoteretro.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://remoteretro.org/</a></li>\n<li><b>Metroretro.io:</b> Another tool to play agile by the book for the retro: creating virtual post-it, drag and drop, give emotional feedback, the learning curb is steep but when you catch the tool&#8217;s essence. You can play along. Still it is pretty sophisticated.<br />\n<a href=\"https://metroretro.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://metroretro.io/</a></li>\n<li><b>Aggie.io:</b> a tool to explain by drawing / sketching, a picture is worth a thousand. You can draw a picture with people in real-time over the internet in your browser. It is useful like a screencapture tool like Skitch!<br /><a href=\"https://aggie.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://aggie.io/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In conclusion</h3>\n<p>I do not quote Teams, Slack, Skype, Trello, Github, Youtube, Skitch&#8230; that are already an integral part of the P.O.P (P.O.Panoply) like the cape or the red nod* is to Superman.</p>\n<p>For sure the list is far from being exhaustive I guess there will be hungry entrepreneurs that will try to grab a piece of this enormous and existing market since the situation is here to stay.</p>\n<p><b>Take care and stay at home.</b></p>\n<p><i>* apparently the real name given to the red underwear that Clark Kent is wearing on both side on his daily superhero works!
