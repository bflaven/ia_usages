## PROMPT_1

As a python, can you write a python script that will able based on text stored in variable named "text" give the detected_language e.g es and the language_probability e.g 0.9990234375.


I am using anaconda to manage the python environment. The name of the env is `whisper_train`. Give me the name of the best librairie that is able to detect BR (brazilian), CN (simplified chinese), HA (haoussa), VI ( vietnamese), kiswahili (sw), khmer.... etc
