# fastapi_cheatsheet

## why ?

Classic repository question:

> Q: How do you add a description ?

> A: A description to what ?

> Q: To the response

> A: Which one, you can add multiple responses to an endpoint...

> Q: What ? You can do that ? You're insane dude my consumers won't cope with multiple answers, status codes, I'm glad it exists but well, let's say I just want to customize the description for the default status code of that endpoint.

> A: Ok there is a `responses` kwargs in the decorator, that's for the multiple answers.
Now for the default status code there is the `response_description` kwarg

Or you could do:

## notes to self while doing this on potentially simplifying usage
1. in FastAPI object, pydantic type for `openapi_url`, `docs_url`, `redoc_url` could be stricter and impose having a forward slash imposed.
2. in route decorator, the order of kwargs makes no sense, group them in sensible buckets, ie for instance `status_code` should be with `response_description`
3. in route decorator the kwarg `summary` is not explicit enough imho
4. explain precedance of various elements better in the docs
5. if you set `response_description` there is no way to set a response example, or is there ?
