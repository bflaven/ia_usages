# ia_deploy_api_ml_architecture


This last post is again a journal to me of an how-to. This time, the post is dedicated on how to deploy in the Cloud a Machine Learning’s features API, built with FastAPI. For the cloud, I have chosen Azure as I will probably work with it. Indeed, the deployment in the Cloud is the last step to close my Machine Learning’s API creation process investigation. Previously, I explored roughly all the required steps from ML (Machine Learning) customization to development with FastAPI, through the discovery of specific packages like Whisper, Spacy for instance.


**See at [Step by step Introducing to Azure Cloud Deployment: Deploying a FastAPI ML Feature API](https://flaven.fr/2023/10/step-by-step-introducing-to-azure-cloud-deployment-deploying-a-fastapi-ml-feature-api/)**

## FILES

**Here is the code produced through the different experiments that I made to understand deploy on Azure for a webapp.**


- `advanced_docker_compose_fastapi`: several example suing docker-compose and Makefile.
- `api_fastapi_routes`: routing issue with the help of ChatGPT
- `fastapi-simple-app`: simple app to deploy
- `fastapi_cheatsheet`: cheat sheet for fastapi for documentation especially.
- `fastapi_tiangolo_advanced_settings`: advanced setting examples.
- `mamamia-fastapi-azure`: application, written with the help of ChatGPT, made with FastAPI deployed to the Azure Cloud.
